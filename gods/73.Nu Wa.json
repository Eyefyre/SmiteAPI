Firestorms, floods, and bloodthirsty monsters ravaged the land and stole the lives of more than can be counted. In ages past, Nu Wa, Guardian of Heaven and Earth, hand-crafted all people from clay. They were her creations, her children, her responsibility.As the Earth shuddered and broke, and the skies turned black with ash, Nu Wa forged five mystic stones, one for each of the elemental forces of nature: Earth, Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal. With the power of these stones, she slew a gargantuan tortoise, severed its legs, and raced to the broken World Pillar. One leg she used to prop the Heavens aloft and with the elemental stones, she sealed it in place. Balance between Heaven and Earth was restored, but the world was never the same. Skies cleared, but the stars had shifted. Seas retreated, but rivers drained westward. Everything leaned, but the End was averted.In the years that followed, Nu Wa and her brother, Fu Xi, took the throne of China. They ruled with wisdom and ushered in an age of recovery and prosperity, for which she is adored and worshipped to this day.Yet, the skies grow dark once more and chaos threatens to engulf the land. Gods from all Pantheons have chosen Earth as a battleground, trading blows with the same thoughtless fervor that destroyed the World Pillar so long ago. Determined to prevent such calamity from repeating, Nu Wa has summoned the elemental stones once more. For she is the Guardian of Heaven and Earth; all mankind are her creations, her children, her responsibility.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Easy", "release_date": "December 5, 2013", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "400 (+75)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "265 (+43)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "355 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "55 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+1.7%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "35 (+ 1.5)+ 20% of Magical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "None"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "9 (+2.7)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "7 (+0.45)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.6 (+0.43)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Strength of Wood", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/365"}, {"name": "Mysterious Fog", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/366"}, {"name": "Clay Soldiers", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/367"}, {"name": "Shining Metal", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/368"}, {"name": "Fire Shards", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/369"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Clay Explosion", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/195"}, {"name": "Skill Shot", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/334"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/42/T_NuWa_Default_Card.png?version=f71548e9d2545e347f09ce13cd079613"}, {"name": "Amethyst", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/6/69/T_NuWa_Skin1_Card.png?version=d6dfbec858a7cb09992fb12285e8b20d"}, {"name": "Dark Summoner", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/fa/T_NuWa_DarkSummoner_Card.png?version=88e330f2a4802192509f3616f8af5dcc"}, {"name": "Water Dancer", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/91/T_NuWa_YouTube_Card.png?version=29ac3497e565e474a3a239d3bcf3e55a"}, {"name": "Nice and Naughty", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/27/T_NuWa_XmasElf_Card.png?version=f65109bb26c14461a66695c78ce6431b"}, {"name": "Nu Horizons", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/2f/T_NuWa_Space_Card.png?version=6fe7b839bc4ee938dc1e86118f259b51"}, {"name": "Aurum", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/c9/T_NuWa_Space_ReColor_Card.png?version=7675ca383e5e3e18cbc05aee86dc9dca"}, {"name": "Challenger", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/3c/T_NuWa_ChallengerBlue_Card.png?version=823a55c8d47cfcb6b89cff20c3f95485"}, {"name": "Ace", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/c8/T_NuWa_ChallengerGreen_Card.png?version=2eded4a0100daf3bfa4e221b9422266d"}, {"name": "Oktoberfest", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/f5/T_NuWa_Oktoberfest_Card.png?version=c76766ae02c22e3c09e3dbce10d7a2cf"}, {"name": "Old Wa", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/e3/T_NuWa_Retro_Card.png?version=d964cb86cd566b64e96586e6ca6e0802"}, {"name": "Empress", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/36/T_NuWa_Empress_Card.png?version=99ade8a2f1065e7e72891816bc8dbcd8"}, {"name": "Playful Bunny", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/37/T_NuWa_Easter_Card.png?version=b242bfcb5aeb3a157452f540e4a7afeb"}, {"name": "Mystic Enchantress", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/9d/T_NuWa_MysticEnchantress_Card.png?version=d098a384f432bef45785a44d331b0fa0"}, {"name": "Cove Queen", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/2f/T_NuWa_CoveQueen_Card.png?version=231554ea4c880a433e0aaecb3041e5de"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/5b/T_NuWa_Gold_Card.png?version=d40138ee69e3848cc6e372ee4b06d24b"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/5b/T_NuWa_Gold_Card.png?version=d40138ee69e3848cc6e372ee4b06d24b"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/5b/T_NuWa_Gold_Card.png?version=d40138ee69e3848cc6e372ee4b06d24b"}]}
