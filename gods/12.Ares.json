He represents everything they fear and despise: war, strife, chaos, and murder. It\u2019s said that the sky darkens when Ares takes the field. That he rides to battle on a chariot drawn by fire-breathing steeds and delights only in the clash of battle and smell of bloodshed.Ares is not loved by his father. Zeus has many sons, but only two with his wife Hera. However, the thunder God has long suspected Hera of having an affair that led to the birth of Ares, perhaps as revenge for all of Zeus\u2019 infidelity. For this, Zeus is disgusted by him.Ares is not loved by his sister. Athena and Ares are both Gods of War. Where Ares represents violence, force, and slaughter, Athena is the embodiment of intelligence, strategy, and leadership. Ares is quick to act and leave a bloody trail. Athena is thoughtful and careful with lives. Often they have been on the opposite sides, most notably at the Battle of Troy, where Athena viciously wounded him and forced Ares to retreat.Ares is the lover of the Goddess of Beauty. Though Aphrodite is married to Ares\u2019 brother, Hephaestus, Ares takes what he wants, and Aphrodite gives in willingly. Their union created offspring almost as terrible as Ares himself: Phobos and Deimos, Fear and Terror.Ares is loved only by the Spartans, who revere the God for his masculinity, his merciless warrior spirit, and tenacity against all odds. The Spartans, however, know the unpredictable fury of their patron, and bind his statues in chains. This is, in part, to prevent Ares\u2019 spirit of victory from escaping Sparta, and a vain effort to keep the God of War contained.", "gem_cost": 0, "favor_cost": 0, "difficulty": "Easy", "release_date": "October 4, 2012", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "485 (+90)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "200 (+37)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "365 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "12 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "0.9 (+1.25%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "38 (+ 1.55)+ 20% of Magical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "1/.75/1/1.25x damage and swing time"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "20 (+3)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "8 (+0.67)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.6 (+0.42)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Blessed Presence", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/56"}, {"name": "Shackles", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/57"}, {"name": "Bolster Defenses", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/58"}, {"name": "Searing Flesh", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/59"}, {"name": "No Escape", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/60"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Meltmaster", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/281"}, {"name": "Two Chains?
