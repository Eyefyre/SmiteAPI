When she was married, she became a Queen. But a legendary journey to resurrect her murdered husband would make her a savior.From the God of Earth and Goddess of Sky, Isis was born, and she was a Goddess in her own right, loved by wealthy and poor alike, champion to sinners and slaves, artisans and aristocrats. She commanded the force of magic, for she knew the True Names of many things. For in the True Names lie true power.Isis and her husband Osiris ruled Egypt, symbols of order and justice, and led their kingdom to true prosperity. But Osiris had a brother, Set, who harbored jealousy and malice, and sought to usurp his throne. For him, murder alone was not enough. Set hacked Osiris to pieces and cast them across Egypt.Fleeing Set's wrath, Isis traveled the land in secret, gathering the remains of her husband. Meanwhile, Set's rule plunged the land into chaos incarnate, and all seemed truly lost. Unable to locate a final piece, Isis could wait no longer and summoned the potent powers of her magic to reassemble her husband and give him new life. That night, their love became a child, Horus, who would avenge his father and cast evil Set out of Egypt.Her bravery, tenacity, her skill and love drove Isis to save Egypt and become the mother of all Pharaohs. Long has she prayed that chaos would never again rise to threaten the rule of order and prosperity, but peaceful days are at an end. This time, it may not be her husband torn asunder, but all the world, and even the Goddess of Magic may not have the power to reassemble it from oblivion.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Average", "release_date": "May 15, 2013", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "365 (+68)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "280 (+51)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "360 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "55 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+0%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "35 (+ 1.5)+ 20% of Magical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "1/1/1.5x damage and swing time, hitting in a 6ft AoE on the final blow"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "9 (+2.7)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "6 (+0.45)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.8 (+0.43)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Funeral Rites", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/256"}, {"name": "Wing Gust", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/257"}, {"name": "Spirit Ball", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/258"}, {"name": "Dispel Magic", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/259"}, {"name": "Circle of Protection", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/260"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Silenced", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/332"}, {"name": "Stay In The Circle", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/343"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/35/T_Isis_Default_Card.png?version=4068d58faf611a92fec2459eb973d848"}, {"name": "Guardian Eternal", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/d/d1/T_Isis_Skin1_Card.png?version=ab7dc72dd8e36ae6dc18ffa5e91a3d22"}, {"name": "Desert Omen", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/e2/T_Isis_Tier2_Card.png?version=22ad03f11f9cffd703a660a7e1ba8ddb"}, {"name": "Scarlet Coven", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/97/T_Isis_Occult_Card.png?version=de18c2bb5f2718f286fe9a0a51a4595a"}, {"name": "Classic", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/9a/T_Isis_Default_Card_Old2.png?version=8b56047bb9c85d0cbb998ec8b97c51e3"}, {"name": "Denial", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/2b/T_Isis_Esports_Card.png?version=661b7d55d18cd384ae956deb7e41496c"}, {"name": "Celestial", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/f2/T_Isis_Celestial_Card.png?version=da37a6af9f1555c715d19fc821633045"}, {"name": "Midnight Raven", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/ea/T_Isis_Masquerade_Card.png?version=eeff008f4b4c0e6311d379a232605d5f"}, {"name": "Crystal Fae", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/4e/T_Isis_CrystalFae_Card.png?version=adde425d4fce2d5a99c159423d1ce0fc"}, {"name": "Alexandrite", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/thumb/6/63/SkinArt_Isis_Alexandrite.jpg/388px-SkinArt_Isis_Alexandrite.jpg?version=a6b53865fe6271d15e08e1d7bb0b6cf6"}, {"name": "Shadow", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/35/T_Isis_Default_Card.png?version=4068d58faf611a92fec2459eb973d848"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/27/T_Isis_Gold_Card.png?version=2b93fa69d504a7957d4778a2f40b49bc"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/27/T_Isis_Gold_Card.png?version=2b93fa69d504a7957d4778a2f40b49bc"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/27/T_Isis_Gold_Card.png?version=2b93fa69d504a7957d4778a2f40b49bc"}]}
