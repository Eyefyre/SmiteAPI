When two fragments are placed they become linked, allowing Heimdallr to traverse the Bifrost. The greater the distance between the fragments the longer it takes to begin traversing and the longer it takes for it to be usable again. If Heimdallr places a third fragment down, the oldest fragment vanishes. Enemies that walk between two fragments are revealed to Heimdallr.", "stats": ["Distance Scale: 85ft to 700 units", "Warmup Scale: 0.5s to 3.5s", "Cooldown Scale: 14s to 210/180/150/120/90s", "Range: Unlimited", "Cooldown: Variable", "Cost: 40 mana"], "god": {"name": "Heimdallr", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/gods/45"}}
