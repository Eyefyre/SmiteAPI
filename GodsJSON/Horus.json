If such an adage holds true, then surely the heads that seek to wear it must as well. Born of Osiris, and destined to ascend to the throne of the Egyptian Pantheon as its divine ruler, Horus is an entity of great power, whose formidable strength is mirrored by his innate desire for balance and justice.And yet, these grand attributes are not what has come to define Horus amongst the divine beings who walk the earth. Rather, it is strife, division and conflict that cling to him like a shadow. A shadow that has taken the form of his uncle, Set.Set stands in opposition to Horus' ascension to rule, challenging so that he might be the one to take the throne and hold the destiny of their pantheon, lands and mortal worshippers in the palm of his hand. Thus has begun a path of chaos and destruction that has claimed countless lives, including that of venerable Osiris himself. Reeling from the cold-blooded murder of his father by his own uncle, Horus swore an oath to all creation, on pain of his own death, to set right the horrific deeds that had been perpetrated, and restore order, peace and justice to the land.For Horus, this conflict will see his kingdom restored to its full former glory, first among equals of all the Pantheons in creation, or should he fail, see all he knows and loves cast into darkness, corruption and ruin. He has become inextricably linked with Set, a shining reflection of his uncle's brooding darkness. Horus knows in his heart that Set will stop at nothing to achieve his aims, and so he must do the same. For the fate of all, he must prevail, no matter the cost."}, "Stats": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "1"}, "Name": {"S": "Health"}, "Base": {"S": "485 (+84)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "2"}, "Name": {"S": "Mana"}, "Base": {"S": "230 (+37)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "3"}, "Name": {"S": "Speed"}, "Base": {"S": "370 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "4"}, "Name": {"S": "Range"}, "Base": {"S": "12 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "5"}, "Name": {"S": "Attack/Sec"}, "Base": {"S": "1 (+1.2%)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "6"}, "Name": {"S": "Damage"}, "Base": {"S": "37 (+ 2.1)+ 100% of Physical Power"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "7"}, "Name": {"S": "Progression"}, "Base": {"S": "None"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "8"}, "Name": {"S": "Physical"}, "Base": {"S": "17 (+3)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "9"}, "Name": {"S": "Magical"}, "Base": {"S": "30 (+0.9)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "10"}, "Name": {"S": "HP5"}, "Base": {"S": "6 (+0.8)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "11"}, "Name": {"S": "MP5"}, "Base": {"S": "4.7 (+0.45)"}}}]}, "Abilities": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "236"}, "Name": {"S": "Resolute"}, "Slot": {"S": "Passive"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/236"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "237"}, "Name": {"S": "Updraft"}, "Slot": {"S": "1st Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/237"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "238"}, "Name": {"S": "Fracture"}, "Slot": {"S": "2nd Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/238"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "239"}, "Name": {"S": "Protector's Surge"}, "Slot": {"S": "3rd Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/239"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "240"}, "Name": {"S": "To The Skies!"}, "Slot": {"S": "Ultimate"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/240"}}}]}, "title": {"S": "The Rightful Heir"}, "pantheon": {"S": "Egyptian"}, "type": {"S": "Melee,Physical"}, "class": {"S": "Warrior"}, "pros": {"S": "High Defense, High Sustain"}, "difficulty": {"S": "Average"}, "release date": {"S": "April 30, 2019"}, "favor": {"S": "5,500"}, "gems": {"S": "200"}}}}]}
