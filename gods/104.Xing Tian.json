Barely clinging to dominance, the Flame Emperor deployed his greatest general, the warrior-poet Xing Tian. Tirelessly he battled the other would-be Emperors but their numbers were too great; their weapons too sharp. Xing Tian returned to his lord in defeat but with his spirit unbroken. He begged to ride out and meet the enemy once more, but the Flame Emperor refused. His reign was over; his life forfeit to the Yellow Emperor.Unwilling to give in despite the loss of his lord, Xing Tian rallied the Flame Army for a final siege of the Yellow Emperor's Sky Palace. While the soldiers crashed around them, Xing Tian met the Yellow Emperor in single combat, the two titans trading blows up the upon the mountaintop. High upon the snow-capped peak, the Yellow Emperor's blade struck true, beheading Xing Tian.Was it days that passed, or years? It is unknown, but there, at the base of the mountain, Xing Tian awoke. A new face burned from his chest. The fire to battle renewed, the now headless Xing Tian rose to fight again.For Xing Tian there is no defeat; there is no death. As long as there is a battle to be fought he will never surrender. And he will never die.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Average", "release_date": "September 1, 2015", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "485 (+90)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "200 (+40)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "360 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "12 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "0.9 (+1.2%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "35 (+ 1.55)+ 20% of Magical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "1/1/1/1x damage and swing time"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "21 (+3.4)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "5 (+0.54)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "5 (+0.45)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Smouldering Rage", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/520"}, {"name": "Furious Roar", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/521"}, {"name": "Hook Slam", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/522"}, {"name": "Sky-Cutting Axe", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/523"}, {"name": "Whirlwind of Rage and Steel", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/524"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "The Rage", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/367"}, {"name": "Whirlwind Of PAIN", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/407"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/0/0c/T_XingTian_Default_Card.png?version=8e61a08e0110b678c80274146e542b7b"}, {"name": "Indomitable", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/c0/T_XingTian_CCskin_Card.png?version=1af3d366a0fc98dcbccf98d0bd2117b3"}, {"name": "The Undying", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/41/T_XingTian_Tier2_Card.png?version=03a28e74543cb45a95820b49ffebf119"}, {"name": "TierMonster", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/45/T_XingTian_Tiermonster_Card.png?version=aded9b283774344d0b8d2cce6466d432"}, {"name": "Siege Engine", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/7c/T_XingTian_Steam_Punk_Card.png?version=ad78f19f2e8bbc05a02042763d995457"}, {"name": "Grove Keeper", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/0/0e/T_XingTian_Grovekeeper_Card.png?version=70af545b5b8ce0b7387c5b0955c7692b"}, {"name": "Whirlwind Tech", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/6/61/T_XingTian_WhirlwindTech_Card.png?version=5f7c4fd81b58ff02e53f44c334d686db"}, {"name": "Iron Tyrant", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/36/T_XingTian_Ranked_Card.png?version=0b6f5a4f09d9857b325dffe16cba73e0"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/75/T_XingTian_Gold_Card.png?version=34cc4dddd29e2614a60eb43f4c073294"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/75/T_XingTian_Gold_Card.png?version=34cc4dddd29e2614a60eb43f4c073294"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/75/T_XingTian_Gold_Card.png?version=34cc4dddd29e2614a60eb43f4c073294"}]}
