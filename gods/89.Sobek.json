Some say that Sobek made the Nile with his sweat and protects those that travel it if they pay him tribute, otherwise he destroys them. Some say that Sobek ushers the worthy dead down the Nile to the afterlife and aids in their rebirth, restoring sight and strength. Some say he is evil and hateful, ravaging those along the shores and terrorizing villages. Sobek, in truth, is all of these things and none.Sobek is not a God of good or evil, of benevolence or malice, but a God of solitary neutrality, unless disturbed; a God that tends to his mighty river and performs his responsibilities to passing souls. The rest of the time, he does what he wishes. For his protection to the living and the dead, he is to be worshipped and respected. For his power, ferocity, and ruthlessness, he is to be rightfully feared.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Easy", "release_date": "May 31, 2012", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "490 (+95)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "210 (+35)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "365 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "12 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "0.85 (+1.4%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "38 (+ 1.5)+ 20% of Magical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "None"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "19 (+3)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "6 (+0.75)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.5 (+0.43)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Blessing of the Nile", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/445"}, {"name": "Charge Prey", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/446"}, {"name": "Tail Whip", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/447"}, {"name": "Sickening Strike", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/448"}, {"name": "Lurking in the Waters", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/449"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Aren't You a Tank?", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/169"}, {"name": "Get Plucked", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/235"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/4f/T_Sobek_Default_Card.png?version=9ad9a451c078a96b8732ed48bd7bf745"}, {"name": "Death Dealer", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/fd/T_Sobek_DeathDealer_Card.png?version=12c786614e57bb29cf22183274144f4a"}, {"name": "Nile Stalker", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/c9/T_Sobek_Tier2_Card.png?version=89bf0add1722d416a314c7474fffcb7f"}, {"name": "High Seas", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/37/T_Sobek_HighSeasSobek_Card.png?version=a8505a4ee4f25ef8fa6020ee81083362"}, {"name": "Crikeydile", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/87/T_Sobek_Croc_Card.png?version=ceb5bd9c2869dfc299a97dc31ff58bb1"}, {"name": "Kaiju", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/a5/T_Sobek_Kaiju_Card.png?version=8714ced41a4c8316ed07505fb7590cb0"}, {"name": "Land Shark", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/41/T_Sobek_LandShark_Card.png?version=35dafaf9ebae8d917aa5f108dada4201"}, {"name": "SoaRbek", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/31/T_Sobek_SoaRbek_Card.png?version=be25bfe61571233f8762150168f3c7c6"}, {"name": "Dragon's Light", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/a9/T_Sobek_DragonsLight_Card.png?version=3b0b084004ea4da551840fd6dae9b287"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/e8/T_Sobek_Gold_Card.png?version=e92318e4aff7915d7a2fb933d7eabe33"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/e8/T_Sobek_Gold_Card.png?version=e92318e4aff7915d7a2fb933d7eabe33"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/e8/T_Sobek_Gold_Card.png?version=e92318e4aff7915d7a2fb933d7eabe33"}]}
