She copies all of their current stats and may use all of their abilities for the duration. She retains her own Relics and cannot use Consumables.\nThe Rank of her abilities will transfer to the skills of the god she copies. This ability's cooldown will be increased to match the target God's ultimate ability cooldown. You may hover over a target and cancel to pre-select them, so you do not need to use the cursor on activation."}, "Slot": {"S": "Ultimate"}, "Picture": {"S": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/13/Icons_TheMorrigan_A04.png"}, "God": {"M": {"ID": {"S": "94"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/god/94"}}}}}}]}
