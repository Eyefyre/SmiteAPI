It is a crime against Gods and Men, but a crime many commit with impunity. Even mighty Zeus is guilty. But when punishment is due, there is one from whom even the God of Thunder shrinks. She is Nemesis, the red-washed blade of Divine Retribution.Recall the tale of Narcissus, so taken by his own beauty. Proudly, his visage was flaunted, to the detriment of all. Until, at last, he was led to a pond of crystal hue where his own reflection enraptured him. So long did he remain to gaze upon this self-image that hunger claimed his life. Thus does Nemesis respond to hubris. It is consequence equal to the crime.Now, behold the war torn land, beset by the wrath of wanton Gods filling the air with blood and boasts. This battlefield is stained with hubris. Unwittingly, these foolish warriors have summoned their greatest adversary. Nemesis has come!No longer will foul deeds engender success, no hoard of wealth held in undeserving hands, no legends told when falsely earned. Nemesis will unleash a tide of retribution. Punishment for the crime of hubris is death.", "gem_cost": 0, "favor_cost": 0, "difficulty": "Average", "release_date": "February 6, 2014", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "470 (+76)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "210 (+38)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "375 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "12 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+2.16%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "39 (+ 2.25)+ 100% of Physical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "1/1/.75/1.25x damage and swing time"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "11 (+3)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "8 (+0.7)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.3 (+0.4)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Scales of Fate", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/350"}, {"name": "Swift Vengeance", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/351"}, {"name": "Slice and Dice", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/352"}, {"name": "Retribution", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/353"}, {"name": "Divine Judgement", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/354"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Back at Ya", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/176"}, {"name": "Those are my Protections", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/370"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/54/T_Nemesis_Default_Card.png?version=110587429c5d2a635df8ca4aa8213a9d"}, {"name": "No Mercy", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/90/T_Nemesis_Skin1_Card.png?version=2a0f121e66ec747c638ad4ec009ab718"}, {"name": "Red Vengeance", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/e9/T_Nemesis_Tier2_Card.png?version=6a7250be12f398588e6b6f9865d002b2"}, {"name": "Blind Vengeance", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/94/T_Nemesis_Ninja_Card.png?version=b400d3e9f9874f7bbb39c491f2b35efc"}, {"name": "AFK", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/0/0d/T_Nemesis_Esports_Card.png?version=947f4352eb17b25df180d37dcef318a0"}, {"name": "Leona JPF", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/8d/T_Nemesis_Leona_Card.png?version=53e4c600a269b95e39707f09332fc144"}, {"name": "Silent Blade", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/6/60/T_Nemesis_Ninja_ReColorCard.png?version=c925182310cf6faa7d048613deaadd95"}, {"name": "Vanquisher", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/0/09/T_Nemesis_Templar_Card.png?version=8bc22e5d5691b5a0fd108af0d3e8308d"}, {"name": "Elegant", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/ea/T_Nemesis_Elegant_Card.png?version=ae77a4ce7627db04d8c6b5bd409f61e4"}, {"name": "Revenge Tech", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/fd/T_Nemesis_RevengeTech_Card.png?version=26145824a7aa629f894ba632ff28844a"}, {"name": "Scarlet Judgement", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/82/T_Nemesis_ElegantRecolor_Card.png?version=cf3c9eb583649ff268efd38e0a420124"}, {"name": "Sweet Justice", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/87/T_Nemesis_SweetJustice_Card.png?version=c075fd371269c46c944f1bd6c5080749"}, {"name": "Executioner", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/0/04/T_Nemesis_Executioner_Card.png?version=929c0c81df9bea46f781de61d57df994"}, {"name": "Modern Mercenary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/87/T_Nemesis_Modern_Card.png?version=774f2d4b9aa38402fbf7bc8eb854b200"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/1b/T_Nemesis_Gold_Card.png?version=5cd4008d90a7cdb05eed21559dab6516"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/1b/T_Nemesis_Gold_Card.png?version=5cd4008d90a7cdb05eed21559dab6516"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/1b/T_Nemesis_Gold_Card.png?version=5cd4008d90a7cdb05eed21559dab6516"}]}
