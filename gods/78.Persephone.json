Daughter of Zeus and Demeter, the other gods often felt fit to decide her fate for her. Demeter enrolled her in helping with her Mysteries while Zeus took it upon himself to give her away. Hades, her husband to be, came up from the underworld and took her away. Demeter, saddened by the loss of her daughter and helper, wept and refused to continue bringing life to the earth. Cornered by a dying world, Zeus forced Hades and Persephone to part.Before leaving the underworld Hades offered her a seed of a Pomegranate grown in the underworld. Persephone was clever. She understood what was being offered. Those who eat the food of the underworld are bound to it and must return. Hades was offering her a choice. A choice she was happy to accept. Every six months Persephone leaves the underworld, soothing Demeter's grief and bringing life back to the world.The time has now come for Persephone, Queen of the Underworld, to return and take her throne besides hades. She has seen the gods struggle against themselves at the expense of those around them. She can no longer watch as droves of mortal souls arrive; their lives cut short while they struggled for each and every victory as the gods they pray to cause their suffering. Soon all gods will see why she is called 'Clever Persephone'.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Hard", "release_date": "August 20, 2019", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "370 (+75)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "280 (+55)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "360 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "55 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "0.95 (+0.95%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "34 (+ 1.5)+ 20% of Magical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "7.5 AoE Harvest Activation"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "9 (+2.7)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "7 (+0.45)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "5 (+0.42)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Pomegranate Seeds", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/390"}, {"name": "Bone Rush", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/391"}, {"name": "Harvest", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/392"}, {"name": "Flourish", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/393"}, {"name": "Grasp of Death", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/394"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Grasping Vines", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/241"}, {"name": "Master Harvester", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/279"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/13/T_Persephone_Default_Card.png?version=621ebf3fc4f04190a03633168d681320"}, {"name": "Withering Bloom", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/49/T_Persephone_WitheringBloom_Card.png?version=8a9764a7b3a8c91f321b0a49230ebd09"}, {"name": "Cute Cultivator", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/12/T_Persephone_CuteCultivator_Card.png?version=f0718aeded3328b20d31810e9e582299"}, {"name": "NecRomancer", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/thumb/4/4a/SkinArt_Persephone_NecRomancer.jpg/388px-SkinArt_Persephone_NecRomancer.jpg?version=6a1905408bad1d6121852650546fb925"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/5c/T_Persephone_Mastery_Card.png?version=4b5d8a526ceeed7e2a46d7a0dafd2e74"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/5c/T_Persephone_Mastery_Card.png?version=4b5d8a526ceeed7e2a46d7a0dafd2e74"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/5c/T_Persephone_Mastery_Card.png?version=4b5d8a526ceeed7e2a46d7a0dafd2e74"}]}
