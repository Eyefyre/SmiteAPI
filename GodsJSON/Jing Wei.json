With focused grit, she hurls the small stone into the watery maw, circling above as it sinks into darkness. Resolved, she turns back to collect another. Jing Wei will not cease until the ocean is filled. That is her oath. And she will not break an oath.Once, she was a young girl, a princess, enamored by the glory of the morning light. She gazed in wonder as her father, Yan Di, the Flame Emperor, shepherded the sun from the eastern sea. Desperately, she longed to reach the place where it emerged, but her father refused take her on the waters.One night, the princess sailed out alone, secretly hoping for a clear view come the dawn. But the waters were churning in a storm. Mountainous waves crashed into her tiny ship. The sea swallowed her whole.Yan Di woke and coaxed the sun from the horizon, only to find the shattered remains of his daughter's boat upon the shore.Yet, even as he grieved, a bright goddess burst from the ocean and soared overhead. \"Jingwei!\" she cried, and Yan Di knew his daughter was reborn.Though given a second chance that day, Jing Wei swore an oath against the seas that took her life. She would fill them with stone until they were gone. An impossible task. But Jing Wei swore an oath. And Jing Wei will not break an oath."}, "Stats": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "1"}, "Name": {"S": "Health"}, "Base": {"S": "445 (+78)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "2"}, "Name": {"S": "Mana"}, "Base": {"S": "205 (+36)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "3"}, "Name": {"S": "Speed"}, "Base": {"S": "370 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "4"}, "Name": {"S": "Range"}, "Base": {"S": "55 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "5"}, "Name": {"S": "Attack/Sec"}, "Base": {"S": "1 (+1.4%)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "6"}, "Name": {"S": "Damage"}, "Base": {"S": "38 (+ 2.7)+ 100% of Physical Power"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "7"}, "Name": {"S": "Progression"}, "Base": {"S": "None"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "8"}, "Name": {"S": "Physical"}, "Base": {"S": "11 (+2.9)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "9"}, "Name": {"S": "Magical"}, "Base": {"S": "30 (+0.9)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "10"}, "Name": {"S": "HP5"}, "Base": {"S": "7 (+0.68)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "11"}, "Name": {"S": "MP5"}, "Base": {"S": "4.4 (+0.3)"}}}]}, "Abilities": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "266"}, "Name": {"S": "Rapid Reincarnation"}, "Slot": {"S": "Passive"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/266"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "267"}, "Name": {"S": "Persistent Gust"}, "Slot": {"S": "1st Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/267"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "268"}, "Name": {"S": "Explosive Bolts"}, "Slot": {"S": "2nd Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/268"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "269"}, "Name": {"S": "Agility"}, "Slot": {"S": "3rd Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/269"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "270"}, "Name": {"S": "Air Strike"}, "Slot": {"S": "Ultimate"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/270"}}}]}, "title": {"S": "The Oathkeeper"}, "pantheon": {"S": "Chinese"}, "type": {"S": "Ranged,Physical"}, "class": {"S": "Hunter"}, "pros": {"S": "High Mobility"}, "difficulty": {"S": "Easy"}, "release date": {"S": "April 12, 2016"}, "favor": {"S": "5,500"}, "gems": {"S": "200"}}}}]}
