Far below, across the galaxy spanning trunk, and beneath the roots, coils Nidhogg, the deplorable serpent. In eternal, bloodless conflict are the Eagle and Serpent locked. Perhaps these two enemies would have forgotten each other long ago were they not able to trade jabs and threats across that impossible distance. Yet, there is one that takes great pleasure enabling this feud, one whose mischievous talent for insults and barbs knows no bounds. And he's just a squirrel.Ratatoskr, the sly messenger, has lived in the World Tree since time immemorial. Where he came from or why is truly unknown, but if there's a way for him to stir the pot between any two gods, he'll do it. He's a master of gossip and coy, backhanded compliments. And yet, all the Gods come to him for news. His home on the trunk of Yggdrasil conveniently places Ratatoskr at the center of all cosmic activity.As Gods from every Pantheons clash, how could Ratatoskr pass up the opportunity to instigate new rivalries? Quite simply, he cannot.
