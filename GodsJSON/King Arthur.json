By his hand was the bloodshed ceased, and all its peoples united under his reign. And with his knights he ventured out, to safeguard with steel all that he had sworn to protect.But in his absence, the order he had won was fated to end, as the King's own son\u2014Mordred\u2014 sought the power to rule for himself. A betrayal most cold, threatening to turn all that he held dear to ashes.Upon his return, the King beheld what had become of his realm and people. He was their guardian, an oath he bore above all others.The battle raged, sundering Camelot as surely as the King's own bloodline. He carried the day, in the end, but at the cost in stone, blood, and soul.In its wake the king sets out, upon a new journey. For Avalon has called to him, and Arthur shall answer."}, "Abilities": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "286"}, "Name": {"S": "Steadfast"}, "Slot": {"S": "Passive"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/286"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "287"}, "Name": {"S": "Overhead Slash (Hamstring)"}, "Slot": {"S": "1st Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/287"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "288"}, "Name": {"S": "Battle Stomp (Uppercut)"}, "Slot": {"S": "2nd Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/288"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "289"}, "Name": {"S": "Twin Cleave (Bladestorm)"}, "Slot": {"S": "3rd Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/289"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "290"}, "Name": {"S": "Sundering Strike (Excalibur's Wrath)"}, "Slot": {"S": "Ultimate"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/290"}}}]}, "Stats": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "1"}, "Name": {"S": "Health"}, "Base": {"S": "485 (+83)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "2"}, "Name": {"S": "Mana"}, "Base": {"S": "230 (+40)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "3"}, "Name": {"S": "Move Speed"}, "Base": {"S": "370 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "4"}, "Name": {"S": "Range"}, "Base": {"S": "16 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "5"}, "Name": {"S": "Attack Per Second"}, "Base": {"S": "1 (+0%)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "6"}, "Name": {"S": "Basic Attack Damage"}, "Base": {"S": "39 (+ 2)+ 100% of Physical Power"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "7"}, "Name": {"S": "Progression"}, "Base": {"S": "1x damage, .33x in AoE.
