He is brash, cavalier, and dauntless, with the power to bring hope to the hopeless and change the course of battle with a single arrow. Voices of soldiers, mothers, kings and emperors, even Gods rise in glorious melody in honor of him; and he, basking in their adoration, shines victoriously.Though Hera, Queen of Gods, challenged his very birth, sending the great serpent Pylos to slay Apollo, his twin sister Artemis, and their mother Leto, not even she could deny him victory. Merely four days old, Apollo, gifted with a legendary bow, slew the Gaia Serpent and defied Hera.In his humble youth, Apollo was a cattle herder. The trickster God Hermes stole Apollo's charges and led them to a nearby cave. From the shell of a tortoise and the body of a cow, he crafted the first Lyre. Apollo finally caught up with Hermes, saw the instrument, and simply had to have it, trading the rest of his cattle to Hermes for it. Years later, Hermes would send his son, Pan, to challenge Apollo in a contest of musical prowess, but Apollo soundly defeated the satyr with dexterous mastery of the Lyre.As Apollo grew into his rightful place among the Gods, his victories mounted, and the songs of the Faithful were sung more and more in his name. Now, they raise their voices for Apollo to take the field as Gods clash. Never one to deny his adoring public, Apollo prepares for one last show.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Easy", "release_date": "March 28, 2013", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "450 (+77)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "225 (+40)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "365 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "55 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "0.95 (+1.7%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "40 (+ 2.6)+ 100% of Physical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "None"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "12 (+2.7)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "8 (+0.69)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.6 (+0.4)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Audacity", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/46"}, {"name": "So Beautiful", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/47"}, {"name": "Serenade", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/48"}, {"name": "The Moves", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/49"}, {"name": "Across The Sky", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/50"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "My Chariot Awaits", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/288"}, {"name": "Serenade", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/328"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/18/T_Apollo_Default_Card.png?version=bb5da63aa9fd0d4bc3b1a12204a5b175"}, {"name": "Slickshot", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/8c/T_Apollo_Skin1_Card.png?version=467f8e00c0f61955a786e80cb5f9a700"}, {"name": "Battle Bard", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/d/d7/T_Apollo_Tier2_Card.png?version=1deaaae0fe25f1ab1bc68bb0c02f33fc"}, {"name": "Elite Agent", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/9c/T_Apollo_SecretAgent_Card.png?version=19fbfa217e7791335ff089857375c31d"}, {"name": "Team SoloMid", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/6/69/T_Apollo_TSM_Card.png?version=f66d4c533a6ad1b688560c6a68f9ab07"}, {"name": "Curse Voice", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/5b/T_Apollo_Curse_Card.png?version=324e015edf177f1bdf8ba07d90c8a872"}, {"name": "Divine Machina", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/20/T_Apollo_DivineMachina_Card.png?version=c6847ff67474ec59277687645b3e4f15"}, {"name": "Vicious", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/80/T_Apollo_Punk_Card.png?version=1a1b447f0f1b9502a26e607d2576713a"}, {"name": "2017 Challenger", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/87/T_Apollo_SWC_Card.png?version=36847b4e31c57ae285815bd120432c63"}, {"name": "Winner's Circle", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/26/T_Apollo_Racer_Card.png?version=6ee115bef49da9b9f7c65c3c58d4c52e"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/49/T_Apollo_Gold_Card.png?version=a7b0627b3b07a3c7393b72242fb90aa5"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/49/T_Apollo_Gold_Card.png?version=a7b0627b3b07a3c7393b72242fb90aa5"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/49/T_Apollo_Gold_Card.png?version=a7b0627b3b07a3c7393b72242fb90aa5"}]}
