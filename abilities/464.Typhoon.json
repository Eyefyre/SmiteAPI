Upon reaching full size, the storm is launched in the direction he is facing, knocking up opponents in its path. Susano may re-activate this ability early to fire the storm at its current size for reduced damage. If fired at less than half of its maximum size, he also foregoes the knock-up.", "stats": ["Max Damage: 215/280/345/410/475 (+125% of your physical power)", "Range: 70", "Cooldown: 100 seconds", "Cost: 80/85/90/95/100 mana"], "god": {"name": "Susano", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/gods/92"}}
