Black against a blackening sky, the Great Mountain's frozen peak loomed.In the crannies and crevisses, in the darkened recesses of stone and ice, the denizens of nightmare crawled and squirmed.

Crystalline silence befell the summit. The wicked waited for their God. The pointed peak cracked and opened, two colossal bat-like wings spreading. He emerged, exultant.Creatures of every horror danced and cheered in twitches and fits, calling to their God. His jagged finger pointed and his minions of malice spewed forth to spread fear and death and darkness.Chernobog, Lord of Darkness, grinned.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Hard", "release_date": "May 15, 2018", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "450 (+80)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "220 (+38)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "365 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "55 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "0.95 (+1.7%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "36 (+ 2.6)+ 100% of Physical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "None"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "11 (+3)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "8 (+0.67)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.4 (+0.35)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Heart of Cold", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/136"}, {"name": "Crystallized Curses", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/137"}, {"name": "Vicious Barrage", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/138"}, {"name": "Into Darkness", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/139"}, {"name": "Living Nightmare", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/140"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Fear of the Night", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/225"}, {"name": "True Nightmare", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/377"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/2a/T_Chernobog_Default_Card.png?version=e2617be4fd5867fdd46743ac997706d7"}, {"name": "Diabol", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/d/d8/T_Chernobog_Recolor_Card.png?version=2c8bae81ed926d6f31ee9631438bb7e0"}, {"name": "Galactic Void", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/37/T_Chernobog_Cosmic_Card.png?version=dc3a201fdc07067e66b3ef967168f626"}, {"name": "Oni", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/b/b6/T_Chernobog_Oni_Card.png?version=728dc23289326e20b80c015dc8e3d43d"}, {"name": "Archangel", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/85/T_Chernobog_Archangel_Card.png?version=482a936a9dd2a5968410c82b589d76bf"}, {"name": "Biohacker", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/d/dc/T_Chernobog_Biohacker_Card.png?version=0f77a7729c43cd5d0cdb0001445ee6d4"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/cb/T_Chernobog_Gold_Card.png?version=31e4dab63e199e428db992c72c08b81f"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/cb/T_Chernobog_Gold_Card.png?version=31e4dab63e199e428db992c72c08b81f"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/cb/T_Chernobog_Gold_Card.png?version=31e4dab63e199e428db992c72c08b81f"}]}
