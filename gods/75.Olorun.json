Greatest of their number is Olorun, God of the Sky and the Heavens, and supreme deity of the Yoruba pantheon. It was Olorun who kindled the spark that would become the sun, and at his command, the Orishas \u2013 the Yoruba gods \u2013 crafted the world and its inhabitants from the gathered dust of the cosmos.But though Olorun is the greatest of the Orishas, he seeks no worshippers and asks for no offerings, yet entire nations follow his ideals. Like the stars, he is a remote deity, content to sit in quiet contemplation of the myriad wonders of creation. And he is powerful enough to ensure the sanctity of his solitude. Olorun commands the fundamental forces of the cosmos \u2013 even time itself.Yet despite this power, Olorun is but one part of a greater whole. A tripartite being, Olorun possesses two other aspects \u2013 Olodumare, creator of the universe, and Olofi, the conduit between Earth and the Heavens. As befits a being of such might, Olorun is wise beyond measure, and rarely acts rashly or without some greater purpose in mind. Peaceful by nature, he will nonetheless fight when the need is great.It is for that very reason that Olorun has chosen to break his long seclusion at last. Despite having held himself apart from the world, he has borne witness to the suffering of mortal and immortal alike. With his far-reaching gaze, he has seen that the thrones of the great pantheons are empty, and that god wars against god.In his great wisdom, Olorun has realised that only a king can unite them.And he will be that king.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Average", "release_date": "June 25, 2019", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "450 (+75)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "240 (+58)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "370 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "55 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1.05 (+1.5%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "38 (+ 2.38)+ 25% of Magical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "None"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "13 (+3)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "7 (+0.45)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "5 (+0.4)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Touch of Fate", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/375"}, {"name": "Focused Light", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/376"}, {"name": "Overflowing Divinity", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/377"}, {"name": "Consecration", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/378"}, {"name": "Sanctified Field", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/379"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Fabricated Destiny", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/220"}, {"name": "Eternal Ruler", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/216"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/1c/T_Olorun_Default_Card.png?version=4267499d79d6cfed86914fbb2d7f5c12"}, {"name": "Supreme", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/0/05/T_Olorun_Supreme_Card.png?version=c0f529afaf6fe4b90736cf6e6c66ae4e"}, {"name": "Infinite Ruler", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/89/T_Olorun_Infinite_Card.png?version=5b1db3bfe9d45ee677d905289f2d6523"}, {"name": "Merciless Monarch", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/thumb/1/10/SkinArt_Olorun_MercilessMonarch.jpg/388px-SkinArt_Olorun_MercilessMonarch.jpg?version=6044560b005b0695353d63c3ec93d54d"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/a9/T_Olorun_Mastery_Card.png?version=952158a3cc74949806e15c4ab9418733"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/a9/T_Olorun_Mastery_Card.png?version=952158a3cc74949806e15c4ab9418733"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/a9/T_Olorun_Mastery_Card.png?version=952158a3cc74949806e15c4ab9418733"}]}
