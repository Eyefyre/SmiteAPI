Not that these creatures could overpower him with strength or guile, but the fierce venom they carry is deadlier than any blade or arrow. Yet, for all the dread they induce, they never strike randomly or in anger. Poison of any kind is controlled and administered only to those deserving of such punishment. Serqet, Goddess of Venom sees to this.Though crushing strangulation and pain await those touched by her sting, Serqet is not a deity of retribution but guardianship. The wakeless dead are embalmed and preserved for all time in fluids taken from Serqets beasts. Of the four sacred Canopic Jars which hold the internal organs of the mummified, Serqet is the watcher of one. And, though her strikes mean certain death, Serqet can cleanse poison as easily as apply it.A battlefield is a strange place to find this Goddess. Normally, Serqet is an invisible presence. She watches. She waits. She learns before she strikes and ensures that those she kills deserve such an end. It must be that the vanity of the Gods has pushed Serqet too far. Now all will meet death with venom in their veins.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Average", "release_date": "July 15, 2014", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "400 (+74)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "240 (+40)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "370 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "12 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+2.16%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "39 (+ 2.25)+ 100% of Physical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "1/.75/1.25x damage"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "14 (+2.9)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "9 (+0.7)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.3 (+0.29)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Catalyst", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/430"}, {"name": "Deathbane", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/431"}, {"name": "Cobra's Kiss", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/432"}, {"name": "Ambush", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/433"}, {"name": "Last Breath", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/434"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Critalicious", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/199"}, {"name": "It's Spreading", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/261"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/91/T_Serqet_Default_Card.png?version=1cf0216468423dd26e59b07d5183f131"}, {"name": "Venom", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/e4/T_Serqet_Skin1_Card.png?version=cc7912c6aae72e8d9513e88099aa05f4"}, {"name": "Desert Queen", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/5c/T_Serqet_Tier2_Card.png?version=10221f63c03a1e81d1bbe8c695d2fe4b"}, {"name": "Madame Blade", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/40/T_Serqet_SteamPunk_Card.png?version=4c12edfdb98b824f5a2aebbfb004e08f"}, {"name": "Demonsoul", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/b/b3/T_Serqet_Demon_Card.png?version=402e00a0111856b00f346d28374d5528"}, {"name": "Dread Queen", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/6/61/T_Serqet_Xeno_Card.png?version=498ce446fd517df242e99680a15e2d3b"}, {"name": "Kunoichi", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/35/T_Serqet_KunoIchi_Card.png?version=4abc89af19ac624dca1eef1f6a824635"}, {"name": "Kitty Kaboom", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/11/T_Serqet_PunkCat_Card.png?version=2e191ebdc47b78965bb30fad58b9a0f1"}, {"name": "First Mate", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/b/bd/T_Serqet_FirstMate_Card.png?version=f49f4e3cdeda627b80109855c1ce6344"}, {"name": "Ebonsoul", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/88/T_Serqet_Demon_Purple_Card.png?version=0b5c8487cb0bd5ad321cc810ecdaf951"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/b/bf/T_Serqet_Gold_Card.png?version=0f8dd28220899639a1fb9eb809188c94"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/b/bf/T_Serqet_Gold_Card.png?version=0f8dd28220899639a1fb9eb809188c94"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/b/bf/T_Serqet_Gold_Card.png?version=0f8dd28220899639a1fb9eb809188c94"}]}
