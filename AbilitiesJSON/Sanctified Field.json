All Enemies caught in the area are negatively affected by the time dilation, attacking, casting and even animating more slowly. Olorun himself benefits from the Sanctified Field in a similar way. The strength of the divine field also impacts the effect of buffs, debuffs, projectiles and deployables."}, "Slot": {"S": "Ultimate"}, "Picture": {"S": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/37/Icons_Olorun_A04.png"}, "God": {"M": {"ID": {"S": "73"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/god/73"}}}}}}]}
