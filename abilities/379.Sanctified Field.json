All Enemies caught in the area are negatively affected by the time dilation, attacking, casting and even animating more slowly. Olorun himself benefits from the Sanctified Field in a similar way. The strength of the divine field also impacts the effect of buffs, debuffs, projectiles and deployables.", "stats": ["Enemy Debuff: 40% slower", "Self Buff: 30% faster", "Area Duration: 5s", "Cooldown: 140/130/120/110/100 seconds", "Cost: 100 mana"], "god": {"name": "Olorun", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/gods/75"}}
