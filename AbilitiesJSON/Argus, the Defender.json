On landing Argus will attack the nearest target. Hera can control where Argus moves through refiring this ability onto an enemy or if he has a target, to recall him. While recalled Argus will defend Hera and attack anyone that gets close. Argus has a hit chain that starts with a normal basic attack, into a ground circle AoE slowing enemies by 20% for 1.5s, into a line attack."}, "Slot": {"S": "Ultimate"}, "Picture": {"S": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/f0/Icons_Hera_A04.png"}, "God": {"M": {"ID": {"S": "46"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/god/46"}}}}}}]}
