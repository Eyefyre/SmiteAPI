He is the God of love and desire, flying about on feathery wings, shooting passion-tipped arrows at all the creatures of the earth. When struck with one of his arrows, man and beast alike fall in love with the next thing they see. Without Cupid's steady aim, there would be no love in this world, which is precisely what happened when Cupid fell in love himself.Psyche was a mortal of astounding beauty, which made Venus venomously jealous. Venus ordered Cupid to sting her with an arrow, then arranged for Psyche to fall in love with a spider. Invisible, Cupid reluctantly went to Psyche as she slept, yet, she woke suddenly and saw right through Cupid's invisibility. Surprised, Cupid cut himself on his own arrow and fell immediately in love with Psyche.Furious, Venus would not let Cupid marry Psyche, so Cupid stopped shooting arrows, people stopped falling in love and stopped worshipping Venus. Panicked, the Goddess of beauty relented and Cupid went back to work. Psyche was whisked to a secret location. Cupid visited her only at night so she could not see who he was. Fearing him to be a terrible monster, Psyche waited for Cupid to fall asleep and lit a lantern. Surprised at what she found, she accidentally scraped one of Cupid's arrows and fell in love with him.Venus was displeased and forbade Psyche to see her son, forcing her to complete a series of impossible challenges that Psyche overcame only with mystical help. Finally, Cupid begged Jupiter (Zeus) to intervene. Casually, he declared Psyche and Cupid could be together. Thus, Cupid fed Psyche the drink of ambrosia that made her immortal and the God of love got to live happily ever after.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 1500, "difficulty": "Easy", "release_date": "August 17, 2012", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "445 (+72)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "230 (+39)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "365 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "55 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "0.95 (+1.8%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "35 (+ 2.3)+ 100% of Physical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "None"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "11 (+3)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "8 (+0.67)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.6 (+0.35)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Lovestruck", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/156"}, {"name": "Heart Bomb", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/157"}, {"name": "Share the Love", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/158"}, {"name": "Flutter", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/159"}, {"name": "Fields of Love", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/160"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Spread the Love", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/341"}, {"name": "The Power of the Heart", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/365"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/43/T_Cupid_Default_Card.png?version=0dcef9f5ef39e6483d208b33f8f4775b"}, {"name": "Forest Nymph", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/0/09/T_Cupid_ForestNymph_Card.png?version=1589f2ea5de0b92e7372a62468bc98cd"}, {"name": "Loverboy", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/51/T_Cupid_Valentines_Card.png?version=eff00bb836b09cc4657e967c277afb31"}, {"name": "Lil' Devil", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/16/T_Cupid_LittleDevil_Card.png?version=88c6c85789b21cf37936bdcfa478d997"}, {"name": "Lucky Baby Fuwa", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/8d/T_Cupid_LunarNewYear_Card.png?version=13899fb540c8240a1fda8cb9d6a62a2c"}, {"name": "Bizzy B", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/56/T_Cupid_Bee_Card.png?version=7babb3d80d3c052a7bff74ce9fa2485d"}, {"name": "Guttersniper", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/a8/T_Cupid_Guttersniper_Card.png?version=09d8b43e1fee7154ed748daa4504773b"}, {"name": "Head Over Heels", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/37/T_Cupid_BigHead_Card.png?version=c8f807cdac51c7b34d024cd9e50ae264"}, {"name": "Trick or Treat", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/3b/T_Cupid_Ghost_Card.png?version=7dd7101451d2daf51a4103f13740594c"}, {"name": "Gadget Goblin", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/5a/T_Cupid_GadgetGoblin_Card.png?version=779bfcab2876b0289fe1213fd8f230ed"}, {"name": "Spooky Nightmares", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/fb/T_Cupid_CuteMythic_Card.png?version=593bd7fc6884b1b57e11b3aee87d0255"}, {"name": "Dr. Madlove", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/ec/T_Cupid_EvilGenius_Card.png?version=780e1626f0028b4119f22bae29d84810"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/7c/T_Cupid_Gold_Skin.png?version=d778b46cf4347faffca76440c6cf4a94"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/7c/T_Cupid_Gold_Skin.png?version=d778b46cf4347faffca76440c6cf4a94"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/7c/T_Cupid_Gold_Skin.png?version=d778b46cf4347faffca76440c6cf4a94"}]}
