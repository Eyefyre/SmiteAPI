Upon reaching full size, the storm is launched in the direction he is facing, knocking up opponents in its path. Susano may re-activate this ability early to fire the storm at its current size for reduced damage. If fired at less than half of its maximum size, he also foregoes the knock-up."}, "Slot": {"S": "Ultimate"}, "Picture": {"S": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/c4/Icons_Susano_A04.png"}, "God": {"M": {"ID": {"S": "88"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/god/88"}}}}}}]}
