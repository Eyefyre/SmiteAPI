Herald to storms, accomplice to lightning, thunder is primal, powerful and chaotic. Let this speak, then, of its master, the demon faced God, Raijin, who summons this force with the pounding of his great drums.Ever in conflict with his equally fearsome brother, Fujin, Master of Wind, Raijin vies for control of the skies above the Realm of the Rising Sun. For mortals, their battles form dramatic storms and devastating tidal waves, but for the brothers, this is just friendly competition; an ongoing tournament to determine the strongest.Though monstrous in appearance and intimidating in battle, Raijin is generous to his Faithful, clearing the detritus with lightning to leave rice fields all the more fertile. That doesn't stop parents from warning their children to hide when a storm comes, lest Raijin devour their bellies. Raijin no doubt finds this tale amusing but has yet to actually feast on any toddlers.War has reached the distant shores of Raijin's island realm, and for the first time, he has encountered other Gods that claim dominion over lightning, thunder, and the sky itself. Relishing this opportunity to prove dominance, Raijin enters the fray, drums pounding, and his boisterous laugh indistinguishable from rolling thunder."}, "Stats": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "1"}, "Name": {"S": "Health"}, "Base": {"S": "385 (+80)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "2"}, "Name": {"S": "Mana"}, "Base": {"S": "255 (+43)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "3"}, "Name": {"S": "Speed"}, "Base": {"S": "355 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "4"}, "Name": {"S": "Range"}, "Base": {"S": "55 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "5"}, "Name": {"S": "Attack/Sec"}, "Base": {"S": "0.87 (+0.9%)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "6"}, "Name": {"S": "Damage"}, "Base": {"S": "34 (+ 1.5)+ 20% of Magical Power"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "7"}, "Name": {"S": "Progression"}, "Base": {"S": "None"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "8"}, "Name": {"S": "Physical"}, "Base": {"S": "9 (+3.1)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "9"}, "Name": {"S": "Magical"}, "Base": {"S": "30 (+0.9)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "10"}, "Name": {"S": "HP5"}, "Base": {"S": "6 (+0.45)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "11"}, "Name": {"S": "MP5"}, "Base": {"S": "4.6 (+0.46)"}}}]}, "Abilities": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "391"}, "Name": {"S": "Charged Tempo"}, "Slot": {"S": "Passive"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/391"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "392"}, "Name": {"S": "Percussive Storm"}, "Slot": {"S": "1st Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/392"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "393"}, "Name": {"S": "Raiju"}, "Slot": {"S": "2nd Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/393"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "394"}, "Name": {"S": "Thunder Crash"}, "Slot": {"S": "3rd Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/394"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "395"}, "Name": {"S": "Taiko Drums"}, "Slot": {"S": "Ultimate"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/395"}}}]}, "title": {"S": "Master of Thunder"}, "pantheon": {"S": "Japanese"}, "type": {"S": "Ranged,Magical"}, "class": {"S": "Mage"}, "pros": {"S": "Pusher, High Mobility"}, "difficulty": {"S": "Average"}, "release date": {"S": "February 16, 2016"}, "favor": {"S": "5,500"}, "gems": {"S": "200"}}}}]}
