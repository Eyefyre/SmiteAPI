This cat, however, has the fiercest claws.Cats are creatures that demand worship. They are regal, nonchalant, and insatiable. Though, as much as they languish in the sun and rumble with purrs of pleasure, cats are agile and deadly hunters. Mercilessly, they cull the populations of invasive vermin and stinging scorpions, protecting the home from vile invaders. Perhaps, the most troublesome enemy of the cat is the serpent, and there was no greater snake in the world than the horrendous Apep.Circling the world along the horizon line, Apep's scaly girth waited in ambush each morning for Ra to rise and bring light to the world. To fend off this beast, Ra kept the company of his daughter, Bastet. Since time began, as Ra lifted into the Eastern sky, Bastet would spit and howl, claws bared against the treacherous Apep. Countless battles were fought, countless mornings faced uncertainty, until, at last, Bastet tore the foul serpent apart.With her greatest enemy gone, Bastet is free to prowl as she pleases. Now, she is the guardian of home and hearth, idol to women - especially those desiring children and exploring their sensuality - and patron of arts, wine, and any occasion of revelry. Like any cat, though, Bastet can still pounce without warning, shredding her enemies once her claws come out.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Easy", "release_date": "May 31, 2012", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "415 (+80)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "230 (+39)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "375 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "12 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+1.98%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "38 (+ 2.13)+ 100% of Physical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "1/.7/1.3x damage"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "12 (+2.9)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "9 (+0.72)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.4 (+0.25)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Tracking Scent", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/96"}, {"name": "Pounce", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/97"}, {"name": "Razor Whip", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/98"}, {"name": "Ensnaring Claw", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/99"}, {"name": "Guardians of Bast", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/100"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Cat Scratch", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/192"}, {"name": "Where's My Kitties?", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/404"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/f9/T_Bastet_Default_Card.png?version=2b8b790b997bd444e2ac870b9c14ef08"}, {"name": "Dominatrix", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/13/T_Bastet_Goth_Card.png?version=7cca979fdd20a3a223e0123a718646b6"}, {"name": "Arcane Assassin", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/20/T_Bastet_Tier2_Card.png?version=f953e0283d09f43753b7b911c938a1c7"}, {"name": "Covert Ops", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/a1/T_Bastet_CovertOps_Card.png?version=e104542b37b7647829bb14486f8af79a"}, {"name": "Kawaii Pop", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/ea/T_Bastet_Kawaii_Card.png?version=c0f37346e534d3eadcb7ff5b4a44c12b"}, {"name": "Epsilon", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/81/T_Bastet_ESports_Card.png?version=589141e5587bf8d3db7d6320835cbec7"}, {"name": "Crimson Ops", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/3d/T_Bastet_CovertOps_ReColor_Card.png?version=a66fa3eb06e0a093f749b6e11f3dee4a"}, {"name": "Star Tamer", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/50/T_Bastet_StarTamer_Card.png?version=d81729ad9367e75f39a3a154429fc4fd"}, {"name": "Shadow Claw", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/e1/T_Bastet_ShadowClaw_Card.png?version=fddaeac09021ec8364fc7a9ebf6f55a4"}, {"name": "Luminous", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/46/T_Bastet_Luminous_Card.png?version=f1377dc214d893f9e6371e9af33b8c2e"}, {"name": "Adventurer's Guild", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/thumb/8/84/SkinArt_Bastet_AdventurersGuild.jpg/388px-SkinArt_Bastet_AdventurersGuild.jpg?version=92f6d92fd298447e2a60ab1a99fd9c0e"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/d/da/T_Bastet_Gold_Card.png?version=2947c8c4f34cc2118e3148fb21b82710"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/d/da/T_Bastet_Gold_Card.png?version=2947c8c4f34cc2118e3148fb21b82710"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/d/da/T_Bastet_Gold_Card.png?version=2947c8c4f34cc2118e3148fb21b82710"}]}
