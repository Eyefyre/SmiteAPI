She sent signs and missives to reject him, but Zhou would not be dissuaded. At night, he slipped into her temple and scrawled poetry across the walls espousing his undying love. This defilement could not go unanswered. Nu Wa summoned the most conniving and wicked Fox Spirit she could and thrust it upon the Emperor with intent to spiral his life into misery. Little did Nu Wa know what she had just unleashed.For thousands of years the nine-tailed Fox spirit had lived, biding its time, honing its malicious appetites. Finally in human form, it assumed the irresistible guise of Da Ji, and to Emperor Zhou, she could do no wrong.With free reign of the empire and its people, Da Ji reveled in torture and malice. She took delight in their screams of pain and she danced to playful music composed at her command, the musicians trembling for every note.So grievous did these atrocities grow that the people rose up and overthrew their ruler. they stormed the gates, toppled the throne, and pursued Zhou to his bed chamber, where the crazed emperor finally took his own life.Yet, Da Ji managed to escape and conceal herself. Now she joins the fray, not to save the universe, nor empower her pantheon, but instead to soak up every last cry of anguish from her enemies."}, "Abilities": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "161"}, "Name": {"S": "Torture Blades"}, "Slot": {"S": "Passive"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/161"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "162"}, "Name": {"S": "Horrible Burns"}, "Slot": {"S": "1st Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/162"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "163"}, "Name": {"S": "One Thousand Cuts"}, "Slot": {"S": "2nd Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/163"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "164"}, "Name": {"S": "Trickster Spirit"}, "Slot": {"S": "3rd Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/164"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "165"}, "Name": {"S": "Paolao"}, "Slot": {"S": "Ultimate"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/165"}}}]}, "Stats": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "1"}, "Name": {"S": "Health"}, "Base": {"S": "440 (+76)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "2"}, "Name": {"S": "Mana"}, "Base": {"S": "210 (+40)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "3"}, "Name": {"S": "Move Speed"}, "Base": {"S": "375 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "4"}, "Name": {"S": "Range"}, "Base": {"S": "12 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "5"}, "Name": {"S": "Attack Per Second"}, "Base": {"S": "1 (+2%)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "6"}, "Name": {"S": "Basic Attack Damage"}, "Base": {"S": "39 (+ 2.25)+ 100% of Physical Power"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "7"}, "Name": {"S": "Progression"}, "Base": {"S": "1/1/1x damage and swing time"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "8"}, "Name": {"S": "Magical Protection"}, "Base": {"S": "30 (+0.9)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "9"}, "Name": {"S": "Physical Protection"}, "Base": {"S": "14 (+3)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "10"}, "Name": {"S": "HP5"}, "Base": {"S": "9 (+0.7)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "11"}, "Name": {"S": "MP5"}, "Base": {"S": "4.6 (+0.37)"}}}]}}}}]}
