So it was in the ancient land of the Britons, a realm torn asunder by darkness and war, that the greatest king they would ever know would come. He was Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, King and Warden of Camelot.His coming was prophesied by the great wizard Merlin, glimpsed in a comet burning though the night sky, herald of the monarch who would unite all Camelot and usher her into a new age of peace and prosperity. Though little older than a boy when King Uther fell and the mantle of ruler was passed down to him, Arthur would rise and take hold of his destiny as savior of his people. Benevolent and adept in statecraft, honourable and cunning in war, Arthur was the symbol of a new Briton.In his hand is Excalibur, that mythic blade of divine power that only the most just of rulers may wield. Ever since the fateful day she first came into his possession, the sword has never left Arthur's side, and countless are the foes he has brought low with her, the blade's power amplified even further by his exemplary prowess in battle.Arthur has withstood any foe who has sought Camelot's downfall, be it the numberless hordes from beyond the seas or the sinister plots of those from within his own house. No matter the scheme, or the enemy, with the aid of his mage Merlin and his knights, Arthur has prevailed, for so long as he draws breath, Camelot's lord shall not rest until her safety is won.Now, the great King hears the call of Avalon, and answers.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Average", "release_date": "January 7, 2019", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "485 (+83)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "230 (+40)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "370 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "16 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+0%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "39 (+ 2)+ 100% of Physical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "1x damage, .33x in AoE.
