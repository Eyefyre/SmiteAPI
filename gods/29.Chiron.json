Two opposites in one form. For all appearances, he is a centaur, bearing the torso of a man, and the body of a horse. Brutish, crude, and violent, the centaurs are not civilized creatures. Yet, Chiron is a scholar, a poet, an astrologer, and a teacher. And for all the wonder and glory of the world he tries to impart upon his illustrious students, Chiron, it seems, must constantly teach them the art of war.Fame and legend are the hallmarks of his pupils. Perseus, who beheaded Medusa, Ajax, who battled bravely against Troy, and Achilles, who Chiron practically raised from infancy, all are figures of renown. But it is for their acts of violence, not art or science, for which songs are sung of these heroes. Chiron would prefer the world a more contemplative place where mankind adored nature and kindled bonds of friendship over scholarly discussions.Though, to his wizened eyes, the brink has been reached and the world he finds so fascinating tilts towards annihilation. Set aside are his books and scrolls, the easel and brush, and taken up are his bow and armor. On thunderous hooves Chiron gallops to the field. To save all that he holds dear, Chiron, the Great Teacher, will go to war.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Easy", "release_date": "November 17, 2015", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "460 (+75)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "225 (+40)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "380 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "55 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+1.4%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "35 (+ 2.35)+ 100% of Physical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "None"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "12 (+2.8)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "6 (+0.65)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.4 (+0.38)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Herbal Medicine", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/141"}, {"name": "Training Exercise", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/142"}, {"name": "Masterful Shot", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/143"}, {"name": "Giddyup!", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/144"}, {"name": "Centaurus", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/145"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Marks For Everyone!", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/277"}, {"name": "3 For 3", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/165"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/14/T_Chiron_Default_Card.png?version=bd9032c07bce35ee94c419321bb37e38"}, {"name": "Sagittarius", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/23/T_Chiron_CCSkin_Card.png?version=a7fd5a1508063c463be6eb26e031100e"}, {"name": "Chevalier", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/73/T_Chiron_Tier2_Card.png?version=01a93b36a218bb2f133cfc18fd9e1875"}, {"name": "Hellrider", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/45/T_Chiron_DarkKnight_Card.png?version=db30fd22366990ee6687c81c65367dd6"}, {"name": "Constable Moosejaw", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/b/bf/T_Chiron_Mountie_Card.png?version=6c25a50937d3c66833a864b0273e049f"}, {"name": "Slay Bells", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/71/T_Chiron_Reindeer_Card.png?version=fcc75753f84754b11e864faf57706582"}, {"name": "Fabulous", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/6/6f/T_Chiron_Fabulous_Card.png?version=8c900f2c473b4caf02a8122d53cda815"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/ad/T_Chiron_Gold_Card.png?version=22de3796adf938dc76185224b4321087"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/ad/T_Chiron_Gold_Card.png?version=22de3796adf938dc76185224b4321087"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/ad/T_Chiron_Gold_Card.png?version=22de3796adf938dc76185224b4321087"}]}
