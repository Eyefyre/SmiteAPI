The topmost of which are realms of torture and vile inhumanities, home to denizens of darkness and malice. Yet, further into the black below, at the inkiest recesses can be found the horrific ninth hell. Here dwells a deity of true evil, gloating over each corpse he\u2019s claimed with macabre glee, and relishing the moment more of these lesser souls are his. He is Ah Puch, the mightiest lord of the ninth hell.When night falls, Ah Puch roams the land, crowned by a wreath of human eyes, gruesome skull face bared for all to witness, accompanied by the shriek of ghostly owls. All that live are his for the taking. If Ah Puch finds a human in the night, he kills and drags the unfortunate into endless oblivion. Only those already wracked by his servants, those caught in gut-wrenching wailing, moans of agony, and fits of mania are safe from his touch.Hide now, all men and Gods, for the age of eternal night has come. Ah Puch will reap anything that lives. There is great vacancy left in the nine hells, and the Horrific God of Decay wishes only to fill it.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Average", "release_date": "April 28, 2015", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "400 (+75)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "265 (+55)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "365 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "55 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "0.86 (+0.95%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "35 (+ 1.5)+ 20% of Magical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "None"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "9 (+2.7)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "6 (+0.45)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.9 (+0.42)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Hollow Ground", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/16"}, {"name": "Undead Surge", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/17"}, {"name": "Corpse Explosion", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/18"}, {"name": "Fleeting Breath", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/19"}, {"name": "Empty the Crypts", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/20"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Corpses aka Landmines", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/198"}, {"name": "Rise My Pretties", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/322"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/30/T_AhPuch_Default_Card.png?version=6dbe865e2014c0ae8f06c7e16e003429"}, {"name": "Death Mask", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/73/T_AhPuch_CCSkin_Card.png?version=5e5a751bd98c2f90f9768844b1361bcd"}, {"name": "Galactic Invader", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/ad/T_AhPuch_Alien_Card.png?version=c8fc29b3f305ae3a8da70add17b386d7"}, {"name": "Nutcromancer", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/b/b6/T_AhPuch_Nutcracker_Card.png?version=a1442809d689bfd4ee63397b437be57f"}, {"name": "Chilling Grasp", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/99/T_AhPuch_ChillingGrasp_Card.png?version=cd26dfad35fa290ad37d33a49e5bad88"}, {"name": "Freaky Tiki", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/80/T_AhPuch_Tiki_Card.png?version=6610b50e955c35597ebed1fd0614638d"}, {"name": "Shadow Spirit", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/33/T_AhPuch_ShadowSpirit_Card.png?version=6212acb616ee0d22ea1f9f8531a59102"}, {"name": "Infinite Seer", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/8e/T_AhPuch_InfiniteSeer_Card.png?version=443dd86462ce5c14f4364e06fa7eef99"}, {"name": "Horrific Harvester", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/f6/T_AhPuch_SoulHarvest_Card.png?version=639b718974346a50344e9f52d84b8ce2"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/84/T_AhPuch_Gold_Card.png?version=88c9642622b00c88b75aa6815368d6ef"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/84/T_AhPuch_Gold_Card.png?version=88c9642622b00c88b75aa6815368d6ef"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/84/T_AhPuch_Gold_Card.png?version=88c9642622b00c88b75aa6815368d6ef"}]}
