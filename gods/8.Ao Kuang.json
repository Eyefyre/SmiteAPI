For their worship, tides remain calm, rivers contained, and rainfall for crops plentiful. It was not always like this, however. Long ago, Ao Kuang grew greedy and expected greater sacrifices. When they were not given, he sent floods, tidal waves, and devastating storms, striking so much fear into the people they dared not speak of this violence to the Jade Emperor. Ao Kuang enjoyed his total control.Then came Sun Wukong to his undersea palace seeking a weapon for his famous journey to the West. Despite the offer of other weapons, Sun Wukong took the Ruyi Jingu Bang, an immense pillar that aided in controlling the tides. It was believed none could even lift it, but Sun Wukong spun it with ease. As if this were not humiliating enough, Sun Wukong demanded other gifts of armor, shoes, and helm, all of which Ao Kuang was forced to supply.Next, the demigod boy Nezha, playing in a stream, inadvertently shook Ao Kuang's palace. Annoyed, the Dragon-God set forth his favorite scout to kill the child, but Ne Zha defended himself and the scout was slain. Furious, Ao Kuang ordered his third son to destroy Ne Zha, yet Ne Zha slew him as well. Completely outraged, Ao Kuang went to Ne Zha's father and threatened to take the issue before the Jade Emperor, but Ne Zha tackled the Dragon-King and forced him to submit.Such repeated shame and humiliation have both humbled Ao Kuang and tempered his fury to steely resolve. Long has he awaited his chance to rise again and exert dominance as a great Dragon-God of the Sea.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Hard", "release_date": "November 19, 2014", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "400 (+82)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "240 (+38)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "375 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "12 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+1.95%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "35 (+ 2.4)+ 20% of Magical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "1/0.5/0.5/1x damage,1/0.5/0.5/0.5x Speed"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "12 (+3)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "10 (+0.7)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.8 (+0.41)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Dragon King's Sword", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/36"}, {"name": "Water Illusion", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/37"}, {"name": "Dragon Call", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/38"}, {"name": "Wild Storm", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/39"}, {"name": "King of the Eastern Seas", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/40"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "A Mighty Sword", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/167"}, {"name": "Water Illustionist", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/394"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/fd/T_AoKuang_Default_Card.png?version=768cb8ee8acdf5abff5a54a968c3f21d"}, {"name": "Tempest", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/82/T_AoKuang_V2_CCSkin_Card.png?version=ecfde29364c5bac03ae72a4ece97d483"}, {"name": "Dragon King", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/81/T_AoKuang_Tier2_Card.png?version=cf7c48e148dd4ad72ae5077b53fb6635"}, {"name": "Clockwork Knight", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/d/d3/T_AoKuang_Clockwork_Card.png?version=853af856666d4a59dc0b8922c5b2d6d6"}, {"name": "NRG", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/4f/T_AoKuang_NRG_Card.png?version=88661f34f85d180c1b0fdf743fa4acd3"}, {"name": "Sand Viper", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/ed/T_AoKuang_SandViper_Card.png?version=52e6d078bda1c15a3f671df920dd3a0c"}, {"name": "Admiral", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/aa/T_AoKuang_Admiral_Card.png?version=7e63c71c078369c0e2e11d1aa4706eb8"}, {"name": "Cursed Bloodline", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/e4/T_AoKuang_CursedBloodline_Card.png?version=72e3cca0dea49cf70489d91889ba2b25"}, {"name": "Dragon Knight", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/b/b9/T_AoKuang_DragonKnight_Card.png?version=94bdcdf42c0b0dca2f4f4eb2639e4c47"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/56/T_AoKuang_Gold_Card.png?version=de46b025ad0082e129629d60a3288285"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/56/T_AoKuang_Gold_Card.png?version=de46b025ad0082e129629d60a3288285"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/56/T_AoKuang_Gold_Card.png?version=de46b025ad0082e129629d60a3288285"}]}
