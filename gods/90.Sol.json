So enamored with them, their father arrogantly named each after a sacred heavenly body, he for the moon and she, the sun. As they grew, each child proved their namesake. Mani, of the moon, was contemplative, obedient, calm. Sol, conversely, became willful, spirited, passionate. His children were everything a father could dream, but Odin and his ilk were not pleased. For their father's hubris, Mani and Sol were punished.To the sky, they were sent, each to lead the chariot that dragged the sun or the moon. At their heels were loosed the bloodthirsty sons of Fenrir. Hungry wolves, relentless in pursuit of their prey.Resigned, Mani guided his steeds through the night, ever ahead of his hunter, but Sol did not accept her fate. Furious at the Gods, she taunts and challenges the wolf Skoll as she blazes across the sky, unleashing her spite on the only opponent she can reach.Odin has never shown signs of regret for his decision, but now war is upon the land. His attentions are turned. Sol, normally confined to her chariot has found a way to send her flaming essence to the battlefield. To the casual observer, the combat, the bloodshed, may all seem just a game to Sol, but she is driven by an age old grudge and a desire to be free.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Hard", "release_date": "October 6, 2015", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "400 (+75)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "300 (+57)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "370 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "55 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+1.8%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "34 (+ 1.45)+ 20% of Magical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "None"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "9 (+2.6)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "6 (+0.45)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "5 (+0.4)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Unstable Manifestation", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/450"}, {"name": "Radiance", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/451"}, {"name": "Stellar Burst", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/452"}, {"name": "Disapparate", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/453"}, {"name": "Supernova", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/454"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Disapparate", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/205"}, {"name": "Supernova", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/348"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/ce/T_Sol_Default_Card.png?version=7c32f4b86c9bd2f482571c064295fd4b"}, {"name": "Supernova", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/d/d3/T_Sol_CCSkin_Card.png?version=0ef7bcb8095ba6a109fed0b3878c899e"}, {"name": "Polaris", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/92/T_Sol_Tier2_Card.png?version=7f12588926f37f3e97f187bd0570fa77"}, {"name": "Epsolon", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/d/db/T_Sol_Epsilon_Card.png?version=4f200adae2246fcb18828d143d8a21c8"}, {"name": "Meltdown", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/44/T_Sol_Meltdown_Card.png?version=3f06e7333aab91bab5cc4ef4c5c1253d"}, {"name": "Cosmic", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/c3/T_Sol_Cosmic_Card.png?version=3c5e2fc4eadcd46f6379d5ff757d6e7f"}, {"name": "Sweet Tooth", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/40/T_Sol_SweetTooth_Card.png?version=ac43abdc95e771932f3f8207f2a60dc6"}, {"name": "Cherrybomb", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/e2/T_Sol_Cherrybomb_Card.png?version=5ea799aba1d09c3f7517223e359750a1"}, {"name": "Steamy Chibi", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/99/T_Sol_Chibi_Card.png?version=dc536aa7ef9ce0e04e2aa3107817acb3"}, {"name": "Sweetie Pie", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/1f/T_Sol_SweetyPie_Card.png?version=968af06f5557409e45fd3a98f08069bc"}, {"name": "Spell Slinger", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/thumb/1/1e/SkinArt_Sol_SpellSlinger.jpg/388px-SkinArt_Sol_SpellSlinger.jpg?version=74390a10e7e3f17b67139812d44b0b8b"}, {"name": "Soulless Machine", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/0/00/T_Sol_SciFi_Card.png?version=3172dff2202738d6a8ef7f5b01526f79"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/28/T_Sol_Gold_Card.png?version=acf289652b7db12055820362eb0d7a55"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/28/T_Sol_Gold_Card.png?version=acf289652b7db12055820362eb0d7a55"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/28/T_Sol_Gold_Card.png?version=acf289652b7db12055820362eb0d7a55"}]}
