The legends understate reality. So powerful is this book that the mere flipping of pages sets Gods on edge.This lexicon of legerdemain was no product of happenstance. Every incantation, every inflection was carefully crafted by a God beyond comprehension, of wisdom so transcendent, he willed himself into being. He is Thoth, the Scribe of Secrets.Three great battles there have been, and at each, Thoth was present, aiding the forces of order to triumph over chaos. When Ra faced the world serpent Apep for the final time, Thoth's spells shielded Ra against the reptile. When Osiris was dismembered by his brother Set, Thoth taught Isis the incantations to reassemble him. And when Horus, the child of Isis and Osiris, battled Set once again for control of the Kingdom, Thoth's rituals cleansed the young man of Set's vilest poisons.All of the secrets, the power, the wisdom of the universe, Thoth has placed into this book. He is the guardian of this knowledge, invoking it only to save the world, to keep it from descending into disorder.But now, the world is falling into chaos. God battles God. The heavens quake, the earth shudders, the seas boil, and mortals cry out. If ever there was a time for Thoth to break the binding of his book, it is now. This world is unprepared for the secrets he will reveal.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Average", "release_date": "November 8, 2016", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "365 (+75)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "245 (+49)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "355 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "55 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+1.2%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "32 (+ 1.5)+ 20% of Magical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "None"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "9 (+2.6)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "6 (+0.45)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.6 (+0.44)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Dead Reckoning", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/490"}, {"name": "Hieroglyphic Assault", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/491"}, {"name": "Evade and Punish", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/492"}, {"name": "Glyph of Pain", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/493"}, {"name": "Final Judgement", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/494"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Narrow Escape", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/293"}, {"name": "Wall Of Death", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/389"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/88/T_Thoth_Default_Card.png?version=6494256e8989628e3411b548fec73dbd"}, {"name": "Sanguine Scribe", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/51/T_Thoth_CC_Card.png?version=e569f46b7077366f1fcb525541de7a0d"}, {"name": "Vizier", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/fb/T_Thoth_Vizier_Card.png?version=e4433c2010647b2edfea284663e18487"}, {"name": "Beaky Chibi", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/7c/T_Thoth_Chibi_Card.png?version=7668ce9710cc717201627be667979cf0"}, {"name": "Geek Beak", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/1c/T_Thoth_GeekBeak_Card.png?version=21f8d8b983372915cffb588482b08590"}, {"name": "Star Scribe", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/50/T_Thoth_StarScribe_Card.png?version=c1d54561643acf9cd695358b789432ec"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/53/T_Thoth_Gold_Card.png?version=c1e31bd57618f947bd2ee8701b2b07e4"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/53/T_Thoth_Gold_Card.png?version=c1e31bd57618f947bd2ee8701b2b07e4"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/53/T_Thoth_Gold_Card.png?version=c1e31bd57618f947bd2ee8701b2b07e4"}]}
