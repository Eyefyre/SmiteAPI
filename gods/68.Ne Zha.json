During this time, the Dragon Gods, led by Ao Kuang, terrorized the people, sending floods and storms, and demanding not just food, but child sacrifices to feast upon as well.Into this world was Nezha born, a full grown boy with laughter in his eyes, trained by the immortal sage Taiyi Zhenren, who gave him the powerful Universe Ring and Armillary Sash. Youthful and carefree, Nezha was also headstrong, often arguing with his father what was right and wrong.But youth does not last forever, and Nezha's life changed defending two friends against a captain of Ao Kuang's army. Insulted, the Dragon God commanded his third son, Ao Bing, to defeat the boy, but in the end, Nehza slew his opponent. Furious with grief, Ao Kuang demanded Nezha's father make reparations for the offense committed by his son, or he would send floods and storms to ravage the land. Nezha, humbly, sacrificed himself to appease the Dragon God, but evil Ao Kuang sent storms anyway.Taiyi Zhenren worked his wisdom, and from the petals of a Lotus plant, Nezha was reborn. The immortal sage gave him new weapons \u2013 the Fire Tipped Spear and Wind Fire Wheels \u2013 weapons to challenge even the Dragon God and defeat him once and for all.Time has passed since Ao Kuang's ruin, but the winds of war are rising and new Gods of Tyranny challenge the safety of the defenseless. Once again, Nezha will set aside his youth and stand against the tide, for not even death can stop him.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Average", "release_date": "April 17, 2013", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "400 (+75)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "200 (+35)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "375 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "12 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+2.1%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "39 (+ 2.2)+ 100% of Physical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "1/1/1.5/2x damage and swing time, hitting in an AoE on the final blow"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "12 (+2.9)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "10 (+0.71)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "3.9 (+0.27)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Righteous Spirit", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/340"}, {"name": "Universe Ring Toss", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/341"}, {"name": "Flaming Spear", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/342"}, {"name": "Armillary Sash", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/343"}, {"name": "Wind Fire Wheels", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/344"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Two's A Crowd", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/382"}, {"name": "Watch This", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/392"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/fa/T_NeZha_Default_Card.png?version=632663fd7618510a11fd7797a2864a7c"}, {"name": "Blue Lotus", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/fd/T_Nezha_Skin1_Card.png?version=9dac12a429840d202585e3f1a4449304"}, {"name": "Cyberpunk", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/37/T_Nezha_Skin2_Card.png?version=51d52ed5945d19520761b2a44ec8a1d1"}, {"name": "Fire Lord", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/b/b9/T_NeZha_FlameLord_Card.png?version=1f843c73bcc8c0f1b442aaa0918bad5b"}, {"name": "Critical.DMG", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/0/04/T_NeZha_SciFi_Card.png?version=2a67a82eb26cdbbbf5bde68920d1819a"}, {"name": "Playmaker", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/52/T_NeZha_Hockey_Card.png?version=1d0ec8352a9117d3b7c55744d7f47123"}, {"name": "Dragon Prince", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/28/T_NeZha_DragonPrince_Card.png?version=ebceb4c0fedd94bc6fcd31ceb76f80ea"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/6/6a/T_NeZha_Gold_Card.png?version=2c59bf832efa02c547f6d54a2961edf7"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/6/6a/T_NeZha_Gold_Card.png?version=2c59bf832efa02c547f6d54a2961edf7"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/6/6a/T_NeZha_Gold_Card.png?version=2c59bf832efa02c547f6d54a2961edf7"}]}
