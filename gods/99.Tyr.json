The embodiment of mankind's impossible ideals. Man is a malleable creature, but a God is stone, shaped only by the harsh weather of expectation. And none have a greater burden of expectation than Tyr, for he is Courage. He is Honor. He is Justice.Courage is not the absence of fear, but the will to face the frightening.Fenrir, the mighty wolf, was foretold to wreak such devastation on the Gods that they sought to bind him. Tyr, clothed in courage, brought the beast to their prison, where the Gods prepared shackles.Honor is not a stubborn oath, but the integrity to uphold what is right, even when it is not easy.Under the guise of a test of strength, twice the Gods bound Fenrir, and twice he broke free. On the third attempt, Fenrir sensed a trick and demanded one of the Gods place their hand into his mouth. If the binding proved magical, Fenrir would take the hand. Tyr agreed.Justice is not adherence to the law, but a code of fairness and morality.Bound by the mystical ribbon, Fenrir devoured Tyr's hand. It was the price to be paid. And Tyr paid it willingly. Even Fenrir deserved justice.One handed, Tyr is worshipped as a pinnacle of righteousness, called upon for valor in battle, balance in law, and the fortitude to face the impossible. As the cloud of war blackens the world, and fear grips the people, Tyr is stooped by the weight of expectation. With blade in hand, he takes the field. For he is Courage. He is Honor. He is Justice.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Hard", "release_date": "August 7, 2013", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "485 (+83)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "230 (+40)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "375 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "12 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+0.9%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "39 (+ 2)+ 100% of Physical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "1/.5/1.5x damage"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "18 (+3)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "8 (+0.72)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.4 (+0.29)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Unyielding", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/495"}, {"name": "Fearless", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/496"}, {"name": "Power Cleave", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/497"}, {"name": "Change Stance", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/498"}, {"name": "Lawbringer", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/499"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Bringing Down The Law", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/187"}, {"name": "I Like To Juggle", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/252"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/9e/T_Tyr_Default_Card.png?version=e7fe0561c345b1adc55ff50c4db49858"}, {"name": "Dark Judgement", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/5a/T_Tyr_Skin1_Card.png?version=a40a3518eb82e4c345df68cb435e5668"}, {"name": "PrivaTyr", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/10/T_Tyr_Pirate_Card.png?version=d8603d5fe64ae8653d019a278ebb3f20"}, {"name": "King Ar-Tyr", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/d/df/T_Tyr_KingArtyr_Card.png?version=7ec5c3f40ce00f08eee4f7405f3f31f0"}, {"name": "Sock PuppeTyr", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/ea/T_Tyr_Sockpuppet_Card.png?version=fc0662206e9dc5fae4a7a64952ff92bf"}, {"name": "Convention 2015", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/95/T_Tyr_Convention2015_Card.png?version=c3273bb2ebc27ce6d5db9318466aa297"}, {"name": "Hail to the King", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/0/03/T_Tyr_HailKing_Card.png?version=beef77acbc6240635c58e77dbcea4fb3"}, {"name": "Draco Knight", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/15/T_Tyr_DracoKnight_Card.png?version=b69f4c24634af17e67d0a35d1a6d8403"}, {"name": "Winged Justice", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/b/b4/T_Tyr_WingedJustice_Card.png?version=c027cb7e77d00b199b90405c351703cb"}, {"name": "Shadow", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/9e/T_Tyr_Default_Card.png?version=e7fe0561c345b1adc55ff50c4db49858"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/79/T_Tyr_Gold_Card.png?version=757abff757c79be7c54119bf27dcf9b6"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/79/T_Tyr_Gold_Card.png?version=757abff757c79be7c54119bf27dcf9b6"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/79/T_Tyr_Gold_Card.png?version=757abff757c79be7c54119bf27dcf9b6"}]}
