Enemy gods within range are pulled towards the Coffin and take damage every .33s. When an enemy god gets too close to the coffin their soul is ripped out, causing them to be stunned, take a large amount of damage based on their total health and gain max Hysteria. This ability persists for 3.5s or until an enemy god is pulled to the coffin.\nIf targets being pulled are above 30 Hysteria, the pull strength is increased.", "stats": ["Damage per Tick: 17/24/31/38/45 (+6% of your magical power)", "Damage on Hit: 100/170/240/310/380 (+50% of your magical power)", "Total Health Damage: 10%", "Stun: 1.5s", "Hysteria per Hit: 5", "Range: 60", "Cooldown: 90 seconds", "Cost: 70/75/80/85/90 mana"], "god": {"name": "Baron Samedi", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/gods/19"}}
