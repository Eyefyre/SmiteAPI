But what do you know of the hands that set those legends into motion? Are they those of a prophet? a demon? or perhaps just a remarkable man. Whichever he may be, the power he wields is not a question.The great wizard Merlin has woven his magics and cunning in service of great rumors. Assuring victories and war, and foretelling he who had come to rule all Kings. Through a vision of clashing dragons, he foretold the son of Uther, to be this great King. As the dragon comet blazed across the sky, Merlin took his place at Uther's side, naming him Pendragon.A name his son would make known to all the world. Standing against the marauding barbarian hordes from across the sea. Merlin remained steadfast at Uther's side, until he was claimed in battle. But even from grim ends can hope spring anew. For Uther's son, now ascends to the throne.Merlin's many and mysterious works culminating in the rise of the greatest king of all time."}, "Abilities": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "321"}, "Name": {"S": "Overload"}, "Slot": {"S": "Passive"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/321"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "322"}, "Name": {"S": "Eclipse"}, "Slot": {"S": "1st Ability (Arcane)"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/322"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "323"}, "Name": {"S": "Radiate"}, "Slot": {"S": "1st Ability (Fire)"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/323"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "324"}, "Name": {"S": "Frostbolt"}, "Slot": {"S": "1st Ability (Ice)"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/324"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "325"}, "Name": {"S": "Vortex"}, "Slot": {"S": "2nd Ability (Arcane)"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/325"}}}]}, "Stats": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "1"}, "Name": {"S": "Health"}, "Base": {"S": "370 (+75)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "2"}, "Name": {"S": "Mana"}, "Base": {"S": "250 (+55)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "3"}, "Name": {"S": "Move Speed"}, "Base": {"S": "355 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "4"}, "Name": {"S": "Range"}, "Base": {"S": "55 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "5"}, "Name": {"S": "Attack Per Second"}, "Base": {"S": "1 (+0.8%)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "6"}, "Name": {"S": "Basic Attack Damage"}, "Base": {"S": "34 (+ 1.5)+ 20% of Magical Power"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "7"}, "Name": {"S": "Progression"}, "Base": {"S": "None"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "8"}, "Name": {"S": "Magical Protection"}, "Base": {"S": "30 (+0.9)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "9"}, "Name": {"S": "Physical Protection"}, "Base": {"S": "10 (+3)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "10"}, "Name": {"S": "HP5"}, "Base": {"S": "6 (+0.48)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "11"}, "Name": {"S": "MP5"}, "Base": {"S": "4.8 (+0.44)"}}}]}}}}]}
