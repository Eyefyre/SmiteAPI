The greater the sacrifice, the more immeasurable the power. Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka knew this. For years he worshipped, showing his devotion through isolation, prayer, and penance before the shrine of Shiva. Yet for years he was met with only silence. In his pursuit of immortality, he sacrificed his very life. He cut off his own head.Agony and pain met him as it regrew. He was greeted not by Death, but by rejection. Shiva the destroyer did not want him. Ravana was undaunted. Nine more times his head was offered, and on his tenth sacrifice, finally Shiva was sated.For the Demon King, Shiva granted a boon. Instead of immortality, he gained invulnerability against those he viewed as threats: Gods and Demons. Ravana could not be destroyed.A master of combat, a genius scholar, a peerless leader, and now invincible, Ravana amassed an army of fiends and monsters to conquer the world. None could stop him. The Monkey King tried, but Ravana fought off his attacks. The Demon King's armies conquered all, leaving Ravana to rule from a golden throne.Vishnu, in his wisdom and grace, would not permit Ravana's dominance. By Gods and Demons Ravana could not be harmed, but by mortals...Thus was Vishnu reborn Rama, a mere man. Now trained as a warrior, Rama calls the Demon King to battle.Pride scraping like a knee on stone, Ravana rallies his monstrous siblings, his conquered allies, and his formidable army to answer Rama's taunt. And their rivalry will shake the world.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Average", "release_date": "June 30, 2015", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "400 (+75)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "230 (+35)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "370 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "12 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+1.7%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "39 (+ 2.2)+ 100% of Physical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "0.75/.5/1.25x damage"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "13 (+2.9)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "8 (+0.7)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.4 (+0.35)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Chain of Blows", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/420"}, {"name": "Prana Onslaught", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/421"}, {"name": "Overhead Kick", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/422"}, {"name": "10-Hand Shadow Fist", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/423"}, {"name": "Mystic Rush", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/424"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Feel The Rush", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/88"}, {"name": "Watch My Moves", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/391"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/7d/T_Ravana_Default_Card.png?version=55e96c361302df99e07f832f2330fedc"}, {"name": "Tyrant", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/fb/T_Ravana_CCSkin_Card.png?version=72fe100e28ff7d00c14883088623d9cb"}, {"name": "Demon King", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/0/05/T_Ravana_Tier2_Card.png?version=2390f529caf2651622ac9035c1bc1dda"}, {"name": "Ravin'", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/fb/T_Ravana_EDM_Card.png?version=b0807a126deefd48014a5b319ee4a94d"}, {"name": "Rock From Bisrakh", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/70/T_Ravana_MMA_Card.png?version=0bd6685794ecd02139816cce6ce84679"}, {"name": "Shadow Punch", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/6/6f/T_Ravana_ShadowPunch_Card.png?version=b510bbf5e2bc3036337aaba9359df3b6"}, {"name": "King Of The Ring", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/2e/T_Ravana_MMA_No_Beard_Card.png?version=fdf29aa98318bccae2aab24b95b3eb6c"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/9e/T_Ravana_Gold_Card.png?version=217a1b61bfa13d961db838f7c49152d2"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/9e/T_Ravana_Gold_Card.png?version=217a1b61bfa13d961db838f7c49152d2"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/9e/T_Ravana_Gold_Card.png?version=217a1b61bfa13d961db838f7c49152d2"}]}
