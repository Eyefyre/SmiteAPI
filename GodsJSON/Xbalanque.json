Ferociously he came at them, but only snatched Hunahpu and tore off the boy's arm. Cleverly, the twins enlisted the aid of an elderly couple and advised them to pose as dentists. Seven Macaw sought to ease the pain in his mouth, so, as they were instructed, the dentists pulled the rest of Seven Macaw's teeth and replaced them with white corn. So humiliated was the great bird that he died of despair.It would be many years and several trials later that, at last, the Hero Twins were able to challenge the Lords of Death and avenge their father, but their final victory allowed them to ascend to the heavens, where Xbalanque was immortalized as the moon, lighting the night for clever hunters everywhere."}, "Stats": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "1"}, "Name": {"S": "Health"}, "Base": {"S": "455 (+75)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "2"}, "Name": {"S": "Mana"}, "Base": {"S": "220 (+37)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "3"}, "Name": {"S": "Speed"}, "Base": {"S": "365 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "4"}, "Name": {"S": "Range"}, "Base": {"S": "55 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "5"}, "Name": {"S": "Attack/Sec"}, "Base": {"S": "0.95 (+1%)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "6"}, "Name": {"S": "Damage"}, "Base": {"S": "37 (+ 2.5)+ 100% of Physical Power"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "7"}, "Name": {"S": "Progression"}, "Base": {"S": "None"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "8"}, "Name": {"S": "Physical"}, "Base": {"S": "12 (+2.9)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "9"}, "Name": {"S": "Magical"}, "Base": {"S": "30 (+0.9)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "10"}, "Name": {"S": "HP5"}, "Base": {"S": "8 (+0.68)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "11"}, "Name": {"S": "MP5"}, "Base": {"S": "4.4 (+0.4)"}}}]}, "Abilities": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "501"}, "Name": {"S": "Dead of Night"}, "Slot": {"S": "Passive"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/501"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "502"}, "Name": {"S": "Branching Bola"}, "Slot": {"S": "1st Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/502"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "503"}, "Name": {"S": "Poison Darts"}, "Slot": {"S": "2nd Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/503"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "504"}, "Name": {"S": "Rising Jaguar"}, "Slot": {"S": "3rd Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/504"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "505"}, "Name": {"S": "Darkest of Nights"}, "Slot": {"S": "Ultimate"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/505"}}}]}, "title": {"S": "Hidden Jaguar Sun"}, "pantheon": {"S": "Mayan"}, "type": {"S": "Ranged,Physical"}, "class": {"S": "Hunter"}, "pros": {"S": "High Single Target Damage, Medium Area Damage"}, "difficulty": {"S": "Average"}, "release date": {"S": "December 21, 2012"}, "favor": {"S": "5,500"}, "gems": {"S": "200"}}}}]}
