Yet, from water comes all life, and from this primordial force was born the first of Goddesses, Neith.As the waters continued to form the world and everything within it, Neith's natural instinct to protect and nurture the people led her to champion the hunt. With meat she fed them and with hides she clothed them, but as the people she sought to protect grew old, or sick, or died on the battlefield, Neith's compassion forced her to change her calling.With nimble fingers, the Goddess wove shrouds to shield the lost spirits of the dead on their journey to the underworld, leaving a loose thread she could trace as the ghosts ventured down the river. As time passed, more and more threads spread across the world, weaving an intricate pattern of fate that only Neith could see.Now, the war between Gods grows ever more fevered, and Neith can no longer sit idle. The threads of fate are fraying at the edges and she must once again pick up her bow and hunt, or watch the world return to the waters from whence it came.", "gem_cost": 0, "favor_cost": 0, "difficulty": "Easy", "release_date": "February 13, 2013", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "435 (+75)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "230 (+39)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "365 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "55 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+1.6%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "38 (+ 2.5)+ 100% of Physical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "None"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "12 (+3)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "6 (+0.54)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.4 (+0.35)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Broken Weave", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/345"}, {"name": "Spirit Arrow", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/346"}, {"name": "Unravel", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/347"}, {"name": "Back Flip", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/348"}, {"name": "World Weaver", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/349"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Arrow to the Knee", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/172"}, {"name": "Gymnast", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/105"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/7f/T_Neith_Default_Card.png?version=72346f8c009a5b77f88171844d489235"}, {"name": "Mischievous", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/37/T_Neith_Goth_Card.png?version=dd2019f1b820f8e5708284da4e27d74c"}, {"name": "Worldweaver", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/75/T_Neith_Tier2_Card.png?version=092d37e070ddffe0964c4722b28d9c1f"}, {"name": "Ms. Diagnosis", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/37/T_Neith_NaughtyNurse_Card.png?version=e5ce59a241a1d00365322eed49d4840f"}, {"name": "Carnaval Queen", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/6/64/T_Neith_Carnival_Card.png?version=8bf532939486fcb98af93f0a526cd981"}, {"name": "BuccaNeith", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/34/T_Neith_BuccaNeith_Card.png?version=d8bd91a2443342377a5549641b759951"}, {"name": "Eager", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/8/8b/T_Neith_ESports_Card.png?version=63d265833a450c61e0bab2cb9ea9d68c"}, {"name": "Instakill", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/45/T_Neith_Instagram_Card.png?version=9be471137d53ccd8e952e0700b2ab673"}, {"name": "Harajuku", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/a5/T_Neith_Kawaii_Card.png?version=dfb1a1b1626ad9472a0ae9ab98c745b4"}, {"name": "Scarlet Dangerfield", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/d/d9/T_Neith_Scarlet_Card.png?version=561eb935c2befd29299a15667f342087"}, {"name": "Star Strike", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/d/db/T_Neith_Starstrike_Card.png?version=df587f87a19e667efb939c532ce56934"}, {"name": "Mystic Defender", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/7d/T_Neith_MagicGirl_Card.png?version=de8863776310e93a82df47c3ec4556cb"}, {"name": "Basscannon", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/b/bd/T_Neith_Basscannon_Card.png?version=f406c2ae7f24c0111a586a5a5fa52691"}, {"name": "Moonlit Scout", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/fa/T_Neith_MoonlitScout_Card.png?version=b2789975c89141a043c1b2f1dd5d446c"}, {"name": "Star Force", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/4/41/T_Neith_Switch_Card.png?version=8c1355551e975fb20484c8a478179748"}, {"name": "Desert Dragon", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/c3/T_Neith_DesertDragon_Card.png?version=c9d97f594e572feebdb58dcbc0b09250"}, {"name": "Sea Shanty", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/6/64/T_Neith_SeaShanty_Card.png?version=941377270ba66acaf4d87d88dd14827c"}, {"name": "Swift Scurrier", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/27/T_Neith_SwiftScurrier_Card.png?version=6e1918a0e6fb8f51ba6f49b836fcc403"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/ce/T_Neith_Gold_Card.png?version=65e25b162cc43d47ffbc8cef9002a536"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/ce/T_Neith_Gold_Card.png?version=65e25b162cc43d47ffbc8cef9002a536"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/ce/T_Neith_Gold_Card.png?version=65e25b162cc43d47ffbc8cef9002a536"}]}
