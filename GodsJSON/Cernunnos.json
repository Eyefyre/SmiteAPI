Cernunnos is master here, and although he has much to offer, he will not tolerate greed.Time turns on the Sacred Wheel, Spring to Summer, Summer to Autumn and Autumn at last to Winter. Cernunnos was there at the shaping of the wheel, born of the womb of the All Mother before Gods were Gods and the land was shapeless. This wheel is not of his making. He is both master of it and slave to it, transforming with the seasons like the world beneath his feet. He bears a heaving metal torc around his neck as a permanent pledge of loyalty to this cycle of life and death that only he can drive.Once, it was said, there was no break between his realm and this world. They were the same. Perhaps a time will come when the world shall once again be his. Then, all can walk among the whispering leaves. So long as they remain humble. For the arrogant, Cernunnos hunts. What are these other Gods? Guest or prey?"}, "Stats": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "1"}, "Name": {"S": "Health"}, "Base": {"S": "480 (+80)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "2"}, "Name": {"S": "Mana"}, "Base": {"S": "220 (+37)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "3"}, "Name": {"S": "Speed"}, "Base": {"S": "365 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "4"}, "Name": {"S": "Range"}, "Base": {"S": "55 (+0)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "5"}, "Name": {"S": "Attack/Sec"}, "Base": {"S": "1 (+1.4%)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "6"}, "Name": {"S": "Damage"}, "Base": {"S": "37 (+ 2.5)+ 100% of Physical Power"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "7"}, "Name": {"S": "Progression"}, "Base": {"S": "None"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "8"}, "Name": {"S": "Physical"}, "Base": {"S": "13 (+2.9)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "9"}, "Name": {"S": "Magical"}, "Base": {"S": "30 (+0.9)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "10"}, "Name": {"S": "HP5"}, "Base": {"S": "8 (+0.69)"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "11"}, "Name": {"S": "MP5"}, "Base": {"S": "4.5 (+0.32)"}}}]}, "Abilities": {"L": [{"M": {"ID": {"S": "121"}, "Name": {"S": "Heavy Glaive"}, "Slot": {"S": "Passive"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/121"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "122"}, "Name": {"S": "Shifter of Seasons"}, "Slot": {"S": "1st Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/122"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "123"}, "Name": {"S": "Bramble Blast"}, "Slot": {"S": "2nd Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/123"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "124"}, "Name": {"S": "Horn Charge"}, "Slot": {"S": "3rd Ability"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/124"}}}, {"M": {"ID": {"S": "125"}, "Name": {"S": "The Wild Hunt"}, "Slot": {"S": "Ultimate"}, "URL": {"S": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/ability/125"}}}]}, "title": {"S": "The Horned God"}, "pantheon": {"S": "Celtic"}, "type": {"S": "Ranged,Physical"}, "class": {"S": "Hunter"}, "pros": {"S": "High Crowd Control, High Area Damage"}, "difficulty": {"S": "Average"}, "release date": {"S": "March 14, 2017"}, "favor": {"S": "5,500"}, "gems": {"S": "200"}}}}]}
