Ferociously he came at them, but only snatched Hunahpu and tore off the boy's arm. Cleverly, the twins enlisted the aid of an elderly couple and advised them to pose as dentists. Seven Macaw sought to ease the pain in his mouth, so, as they were instructed, the dentists pulled the rest of Seven Macaw's teeth and replaced them with white corn. So humiliated was the great bird that he died of despair.It would be many years and several trials later that, at last, the Hero Twins were able to challenge the Lords of Death and avenge their father, but their final victory allowed them to ascend to the heavens, where Xbalanque was immortalized as the moon, lighting the night for clever hunters everywhere.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Average", "release_date": "December 21, 2012", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "455 (+75)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "220 (+37)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "365 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "55 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "0.95 (+1%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "37 (+ 2.5)+ 100% of Physical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "None"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "12 (+2.9)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "8 (+0.68)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "4.4 (+0.4)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Dead of Night", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/515"}, {"name": "Branching Bola", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/516"}, {"name": "Poison Darts", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/517"}, {"name": "Rising Jaguar", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/518"}, {"name": "Darkest of Nights", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/519"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "It's So Dark", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/260"}, {"name": "More Power", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/284"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/ee/T_Xbalanque_Default_Card.png?version=6b2f16fb437fbf732fcff565fe48dfee"}, {"name": "Jungle Beast", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/34/T_Xbalanque_Skin1_Card.png?version=0378dfe375ef450e971c5f1aa7cd7f98"}, {"name": "Shinobalanque", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/f9/T_Xbalanque_Ninja_Card.png?version=def59e5b85933f62e5b63f412e4d09b0"}, {"name": "Jaguar Footballer", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/c1/T_Xbalanque_Futbol_Main_Card.png?version=b77b0d87d5c5b270c4a38c1ab93dce00"}, {"name": "Jag.RAR", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/2e/T_Xbalanque_Digital_Card.png?version=4d3e904b3aa75129dac3bc708f13355d"}, {"name": "Fire Dancer", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/13/T_Xbalanque_Polynesian_Card.png?version=b784c79adda1dd69b998dee8e6303b21"}, {"name": "Titanium Tracker", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/d/da/T_Xbalanque_TitaniumTracker_Card.png?version=c58d35f4654e86557e2a5d5c4fa07f64"}, {"name": "Fun-pocalypse", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/79/T_Xbalanque_Funpocalypse_Card.png?version=4db1e8f95665261e56b8ac37dd653a43"}, {"name": "EDM", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/10/T_Xbalanque_EDM_Card.png?version=ed811e9a370dbaee12cf197be398624a"}, {"name": "Football Star 2014", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/c/c0/T_Xbalanque_Futbol_Card.png?version=041c94aad36ec1eef8f71fe0d476731c"}, {"name": "Weltmeister 2014", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/97/T_Xbalanque_WorldChampion_Card.png?version=ac4c8dcaaf360fb91565b68fa557a132"}, {"name": "SPL 2015 (NA)", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/53/T_Xbalanque_Season2_Red_Card_NA.png?version=c9ee6913ba48bf6d92db87f18b01d0e0"}, {"name": "SPL 2015 (EU)", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/13/T_Xbalanque_Season2_Blue_Card_EU.png?version=26538eebe45c187afc6dac21c67bd672"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/5e/T_Xbalanque_Gold_Card.png?version=c460e507705bc6a173d76c3d6b5bfd09"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/5e/T_Xbalanque_Gold_Card.png?version=c460e507705bc6a173d76c3d6b5bfd09"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/5e/T_Xbalanque_Gold_Card.png?version=c460e507705bc6a173d76c3d6b5bfd09"}]}
