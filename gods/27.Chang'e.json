Such is the tale of Chang\u2019e, Goddess of the Moon.Among the immortals that lived in the Heavens, Chang\u2019e was the most elegant dancer, like a dove on windswept currents. She drew the affection of the hero archer, Hou Yi, and the two were soon married. Everything was perfect.Yet, beneath the Heavens, all was not well. Ten suns, the ten children of the Jade Emperor, rose to scorch the earth and boil the seas. Brave, Hou Yi, bow in hand, shot nine from the sky, sparing only one. Though the world was saved, the Jade Emperor was furious his children were killed. In punishment, Hou Yi and Chang\u2019e were made mortal.Chang\u2019e grew melancholy and danced no more. To restore their status in the Heavens, Hou Yi found the Elixir of Immortality, but thieves came to steal it while he was hunting. Chang\u2019e struggled to hide the Elixir, but, in the end, was forced to drink it. Too much for one person, the Elixir gave her immortality, but it also swept her into the sky.Since then, Chang\u2019e has lived on the moon, forbidden to see her husband, a Jade Rabbit her only companion. Yet, the Earth is once again in peril, and Chang\u2019e finds herself upon the mortal surface. Perhaps, this is a second chance. If only she can save the world without angering the Jade Emperor, she can at last reunite with her husband.", "gem_cost": 200, "favor_cost": 5500, "difficulty": "Average", "release_date": "July 24, 2013", "stats": [{"stat": "Health", "value": "375 (+70)"}, {"stat": "Mana", "value": "310 (+48)"}, {"stat": "Speed", "value": "355 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Range", "value": "55 (+0)"}, {"stat": "Attack Speed", "value": "1 (+0.95%)"}, {"stat": "Basic Attack Damage", "value": "32 (+ 1.45)+ 20% of Magical Power"}, {"stat": "Progression", "value": "None"}, {"stat": "Physical Protection", "value": "11 (+2.7)"}, {"stat": "Magical Protection", "value": "30 (+0.9)"}, {"stat": "HP5", "value": "6 (+0.45)"}, {"stat": "MP5", "value": "5.5 (+0.44)"}], "abilities": [{"name": "Jade Rabbit", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/131"}, {"name": "Crescent Moon Dance", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/132"}, {"name": "Moonlit Waltz", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/133"}, {"name": "Moonflower Dance", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/134"}, {"name": "Waxing Moon", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/abilities/135"}], "related_achievements": [{"name": "Jade, Go", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/262"}, {"name": "My Hips Don't Lie", "url": "https://smiteapi.adammackle.com/achievements/289"}], "skins": [{"name": "Default", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/ae/T_ChangE_Default_Card.png?version=d32929a266f51061be108c832dfdac16"}, {"name": "Bright Moon", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/30/T_ChangE_Skin1_Card.png?version=e0e30ecfbfd39ad7a94891ede12bd6e1"}, {"name": "Hunter's Moon", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/af/T_Change_Tier2_Card.png?version=a73ea248ce3b206a34d590f9dc575c3b"}, {"name": "Sun's Bride", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/f/f5/T_ChangE_Couple_Card.png?version=ee58ffba5dec2434ad386986517be570"}, {"name": "Enchanted", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/3/33/T_ChangE_Enchanted_Card.png?version=c9930b074bb095dc44f4a89d77925744"}, {"name": "Moonlight Love", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/9/97/T_ChangE_Valentine_Card.png?version=09e32dd92c8d8a31228916287a35d431"}, {"name": "Lunar Tango", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/5/5a/T_ChangE_LatinDancer_Card.png?version=20b6adc247fcbaa573d9c6c355a827ca"}, {"name": "Countess", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/2/21/T_ChangE_Countess_Card.png?version=5b64aa5a772590347638cb2d3b9d9bcf"}, {"name": "Spellbound", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/6/6b/T_ChangE_Spellbound_Card.png?version=24ab0435ca1efc6cc4b1df1594af775b"}, {"name": "Pirate Admiral", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/a/a2/T_ChangE_PirateAdmiral_Card.png?version=3fe65846917c3291761173bbb5cc5a5b"}, {"name": "Pirate Queen", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/1/14/T_ChangE_PirateQueen_Card.png?version=caed3ff5138b799ba646667332b4108b"}, {"name": "Intergalactic", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/7/72/T_ChangeE_SpacePrin_Card.png?version=4d99336279981d09c957b6ee9d4bdb03"}, {"name": "Golden", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/e0/T_ChangE_Gold_Card.png?version=b96d321a327eb0709a56add994109ac5"}, {"name": "Legendary", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/e0/T_ChangE_Gold_Card.png?version=b96d321a327eb0709a56add994109ac5"}, {"name": "Diamond", "card": "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/smite_gamepedia/e/e0/T_ChangE_Gold_Card.png?version=b96d321a327eb0709a56add994109ac5"}]}
